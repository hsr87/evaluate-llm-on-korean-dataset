EXAMPLE:
Question: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

Solution:
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
So she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left to sell.
She sells each egg for $2.
Therefore, she makes 9 × $2 = $18 per day.

### ANSWER
18

Now solve the given problem following this format."""
