TK_2016_45,Textual,0,C,A,"The question asks which labeled sentence best fits into the blank (<보기>) in the context. The passage states that despite concerns about drone popularization, the government decided to invest in drone-related new industries. The logical progression after this decision would be to explain *why* the government is actively supporting the drone industry. Sentence ㉠ directly provides this explanation by stating: ""The reason the government actively supports the drone industry in this way is because the fields where this technology can be applied are limitless."" This serves as a clear causal link between the decision and its rationale. The following sentences (㉡, ㉢, ㉣) then elaborate on applications, expected outcomes, and remaining challenges, which align with ㉠ as the introductory explanatory statement. The other options either provide supporting details (㉡), discuss consequences (㉢), or address risks (㉣), making them less appropriate as the immediate justification for the decision.

PSE_history_19_18,History,0,B,D,"### ANSWER  
D  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A (㉠):** 사간원 정언 (Saganwon jeong-eon) primarily monitored the king’s conduct and conveyed his speeches, not general secretarial duties. The description overstates their role as a ""비서기관"" (secretariat), which is inaccurate.  
- **Option B (㉡):** 이조좌랑 (Ijo Jwarang) was a mid-level official in the Ministry of Rites and had no authority to recommend 삼사 (Samsa) officials, which were appointed through other channels.  
- **Option C (㉢):** 승정원 우부승지 (Seungjeongwon Ubu-seungji) executed administrative tasks under the king’s policies, not criticism of them. Censorship was the role of 사간원 or 사헌부.  
- **Option D (㉣):** 홍문관 부제학 (Hongmungwan Bujehak) oversaw academic and literary work, including compiling and publishing texts like 성학집요. This aligns perfectly with their duty of handling book publication and printing.  

Thus, **D** is the only correct description.

A  

**Reasoning:**  
Option A states that Constitutional Court judges cannot be dismissed except through impeachment or a criminal sentence of imprisonment or more. This aligns with the strict tenure protection for Constitutional Court judges in South Korea, as specified in the Constitutional Court Act. Unlike ordinary judges, Constitutional Court judges can only be removed via impeachment or a final criminal judgment imposing imprisonment (or higher), with no provision for dismissal by the Court itself or other bodies.

C

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks for the correct description of daily life during the Neolithic period (신석기 시대) in Korean history, based on the discovery of stone and bone tools. Option A mentions using a crescent stone axe to harvest rice, but rice cultivation became prominent later in the Neolithic and was not the primary activity during the earliest phases. Option B is incorrect because corn (옥수수) was not cultivated in Neolithic Korea. Option D describes burial in clay pots, which is more characteristic of later Bronze Age cultures (e.g., Mumun period), not the early Neolithic. Option C correctly identifies that during the Neolithic period, especially in its early stages, people primarily obtained food through hunting and fishing, supplemented by early agricultural practices. This aligns with archaeological evidence from the period, where hunting and fishing remained significant components of subsistence before agriculture became dominant. Thus, **C** is the best answer."

---

### Key Observations from the Draft (나):

1. **Definition and Clarification**: The draft begins by defining *게임화* and clarifies that *게임* here is **not limited to computer games**, but includes any activity with rules — this is a **definition strategy**, not a contrast between multiple core concepts of gamification itself.
   
2. **Characteristics of Gamification**: The draft explains the **three key characteristics** of gamification:
   - Providing engaging tasks
   - Inducing competition
   - Offering rewards for achievement

3. **Examples Across Fields**: It provides **concrete examples** from education (history class quiz), health (fitness apps), and marketing (airline miles), illustrating how gamification is applied in various domains.

4. **Target Audience Consideration**: It **defines terms** (e.g., explaining what “게임” means in this context) to assist readers unfamiliar with the concept — appropriate for the intended audience of students.

5. **Shared Experience**: It uses a **school-based example** (history class activity), which is relevant and relatable to the target audience (students), thus leveraging shared experience.

---

### Evaluation of Each Option:

- **Option A**: *“제재에 대한 정보를 전달하기 위해 개념 간의 차이를 중심으로 대조한다.”*  
  → This suggests that the **main strategy** used was **contrasting different concepts** to convey information about gamification. However, the **only contrast** in the draft is between *컴퓨터 게임* and a broader definition of *게임* — this is a **preliminary"

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which foreign word transliteration does **not** follow Korean foreign word spelling rules.  
- **A (thriller → 스릴러):** Correct. ""th"" is transliterated as ""스"", ""r"" as ""르"", and ""er"" as ""어"".  
- **B (workshop → 워크숍):** Correct. Standard transliteration: ""work"" = 워크, ""shop"" = 숍.  
- **D (highlight → 하이라이트):** Correct. Common and standard transliteration.  
- **C (English → 잉글리쉬):** **Incorrect.** The proper transliteration of ""English"" (as a language) follows established usage **영어**, not잉글리쉬. Even when transliterating phonetically, the ""ng"" sound at the start should be **영** (e.g., 영글리시), not **잉**. Thus, **잉글리쉬** violates standard foreign word spelling rules.  

Hence, **C** is the answer."

**Reasoning:**  
The question describes a volcanic island rising 3,150m from the seabed, with steep slopes and a pentagonal shape. Options A, B, and C refer to features of other locations (A, B, C) and are irrelevant to the described island. Option D claims the island is mainly granite, but volcanic islands are typically composed of extrusive igneous rocks (e.g., basalt), not intrusive granite. Option E states the island was connected to land during the last glacial period, which aligns with geological knowledge: during glacial maxima, sea levels dropped significantly (up to ~120m), potentially connecting coastal islands to mainland landmasses via exposed continental shelves—a common concept in Korean geography for certain islands. Thus, E is the correct explanation.

The question asks for the correct explanation corresponding to the labels ᄀ, ᄂ, ᄃ, ᄅ, ᄆ in the given Korean geography description of mountain ranges.  

- **ᄀ** refers to ""low-altitude, gentle-slope mountainous areas widely distributed."" Option A attributes this to solution-formed hilly areas along the South Coast, but the original description emphasizes long-term erosion in stable conditions, not specifically solution or the South Coast. This is inconsistent.  
- **ᄂ** refers to ""long-term erosion as the reason for the widespread low, gentle mountains."" Option B claims granite exposure, which is unrelated to erosion and misrepresents ᄂ.  
- **ᄃ** refers to ""primary mountain ranges formed by Neogene crustal movements."" Option C mentions the Daebo granite intrusion during the Josan movement, but Daebo granite is Paleoproterozoic (much older than Neogene), making this incorrect.  
- **ᄅ** refers to ""secondary mountain ranges formed by differential erosion along structural lines from earlier crustal movements."" Option D states that ""when the high-level plain was dismantled, mountain ranges in the Korean direction were formed,"" which aligns perfectly with the formation of secondary ranges via differential erosion of uplifted peneplains along ancient structural lines—a standard geological explanation in Korean geography.  
- **ᄆ** refers to ""volcanoes formed during Tertiary and Quaternary volcanic activity."" Option E mentions Terra Rossa soil, which typically forms on limestone (not volcanic substrates), making it inconsistent with volcanic formation.  

Option D is the only one that accurately matches the description for its respective label (ᄅ).

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** correctly describes Hyangga structures (4, 8, 10 lines) and the ""연"" (linked) classification, which aligns with historical categorizations.  
- **Option B** accurately states that Hyangga was recorded using *Hyangchal*, a script employing Hanja for sound (*음*) and meaning (*훈*).  
- **Option C** lists verified major Hyangga works: *헌화가* (The Spirit Flower), *제망매가* (a variant spelling of *지망매가*, The Orphan’s Lament), and *찬기파랑가* (a recognized title).  
- **Option D** is **incorrect** because *삼국유사* (Samguk Yusa) does **not** contain 14 Hyangga poems, and *균여전* is not a valid historical text preserving Hyangga. The primary source for Hyangga is *삼국사기* (Samguk Sagi), which contains 25 poems, not the claimed numbers here.  

Thus, **D** is the wrong statement.

KHB_66_47,History,0,A,D,"To determine the correct answer, analyze each option against historical facts provided in the question and known achievements of the figures.

- **원효 (Wonhyo)**: The question states he wrote *무애가* (Muaega) to popularize Buddhism. Option A claims he wrote *십문화쟁론* (Simmunhwajeongron). While Wonhyo did author significant works, *십문화쟁론* is not a widely recognized or standard attribution for him. His famous work is *십玄論* (Simmunhwajeongron), but the phrasing here may be misleading or incorrect in this context.

- **혜초 (Hyecho)**: The question notes he pilgrimaged and wrote *왕오천축국전*. Option B claims he founded *해동 천태종* (Haedong Cheontaejong). This is **incorrect**; the Cheontae school in Korea was founded by **Uicheon** in the Goryeo dynasty, not Hyecho.

- **지눌 (Jinul)**: The question states he introduced *돈오점수* and *정혜쌍수*. Option C claims he composed *세속 5계* (Secular Five Precepts). Jinul is historically recognized for authoring the *세속오계* (Five Precepts for Secular Life), a guide for lay Buddhists. The use of ""5계"" here is an acceptable numerical shorthand for *오계* in Korean historical contexts, making this statement **accurate**.

- **유정 (Yujeong)**: The question describes him leading a guerrilla army during the Imjin War. Option D claims he proposed *"

This directly aligns with choice A. Choice B is incorrect because the class became the cleanest (""가장 깨끗한 반이 되었다""). Choice C is false since the students previously ignored the old teacher (""죽어라고 안 듣던말썽꾸러기들""). Choice D is wrong because the teacher understood the narrator's struggle rather than scolding (""공부 못하는 죄를 추궁당하는 것이 아니라... 이해받는"").

**Reasoning:**  
In Korean Buddhist tradition, the five pungent vegetables (오신채) prohibited in temples typically include **마늘 (garlic)**, **부추 (leek)**, **고추 (chili pepper)**, **양파 (onion)**, and **아사포에타다 (asafoetida)**. While **파 (scallion/green onion)** is a type of allium similar to 부추 and 양파, it is often distinguished in practice. **부추**, **마늘**, and **고추** are explicitly prohibited, whereas **파** is generally *not* listed among the prohibited 오신채 in standard references. Thus, **파** is the correct answer as it is **not** one of the prohibited items.

CSAT_korean_06_11,Grammar,0,E,B,"The question asks which counter-comment is unnatural when attempting to refute the original statement by inversely using the described ""cow-like"" trait. Each option pairs a negative trait from the original text with a proposed counter-argument. A natural refutation would transform the perceived negative trait into a positive necessity. 

- **Option A** reframes indifference (무관심) as respectful boundary-keeping, which logically counters the criticism.  
- **Option C** reframes dwelling on the past (두고두고 지난 일에 연연) as necessary reflection, turning a flaw into a virtue.  
- **Option D** reframes bullheadedness (황소고집) as beneficial firmness in correct beliefs, a valid positive spin.  
- **Option E** reframes aggressive reactions to advice as decisive action, which can be seen as a necessary trait.  

However, **Option B** claims that slowness causing interference (느려 터져서 타인에게 방해가 된다) should be met with advocacy for slow processing (천천히 여유를 가지고 일을 처리하는 사람이 필요하다). The original explicitly states that the slowness *leads to harmful interference*, yet the counter ignores this negative consequence and simply promotes slowness as good. This fails to address or invert the core issue (interference), making it an unnatural and illogical refutation compared to the other options, which successfully reframe negatives as positives.

### Reasoning:
- **Option A** correctly describes the structural form of 평시조 as having a regular pattern of 4 음보 (rhythmic units) in 3 lines, which is accurate.
- **Option B** claims that the fourth 음보 in the last line uses a declarative ending (평서형 어미) to create a lingering impression (여운). However, in 평시조, the declarative ending in the final line serves to **conclude** the poem, not to leave an open or lingering effect. Lingering impressions are typically associated with unresolved or connective endings, not declarative ones, making this statement incorrect.
- **Option C** states that 평시조 can be sung as 가곡창 (with Gagok accompaniment) or 시조창 (as a sijo song). Both methods are recognized performance styles for sijo poetry, including 평시조, so this is correct.
- **Option D** lists authors like"

D  

**Reasoning:**  
The described burial custom—temporary burial followed by bone collection into a communal bone house (*목곽*), with rice jars hung at the entrance—is explicitly attributed to **Goguryeo** in the *삼국지 위서 동이전* (Wei Shu Dongijeon). Among the choices:  
- **A** refers to a marriage custom (*민며느리제*) associated with **Baekje**, not Goguryeo.  
- **B** and **C** describe administrative or sacred area claims unrelated to the burial practice or Goguryeo-specific rituals.  
- **D** mentions *무천* (Mucheon), a celestial worship ritual historically performed by **Goguryeo**, aligning with the kingdom tied to the described burial custom.  

Thus, **D** is the only option correctly associating a ritual with the country (Goguryeo) that practiced the burial custom in the question.

PSE_history_22_6,History,0,C,A,"The question asks for the correct historical description of the king mentioned in the passage from *Shin Tang Shu*, which refers to the son of Dae Jo-yeong (the founder of Balhae) who succeeded him, expanded territory, and changed the era name to In'an. This king is Dae Munwu (UV).  

- **Option A** states that he moved the capital to Sanggyeong City. Historically, Dae Munwu relocated the capital from Dongmo Mountain to Sanggyeong (Xingjing) around 732, aligning with the passage’s context of territorial expansion.  
- **Option B** references ""Hadong Seongguk,"" which describes Silla’s peak, not Balhae, making it incorrect.  
- **Option C** claims he ""declared a prolonged truce and attacked Dengzhou."" While Balhae did attack Dengzhou in 732, there is no historical record of a preceding truce (""장문휴""), rendering this detail inaccurate.  
- **Option D** describes establishing Dongmo Mountain as the capital, which was done by Dae Jo-yeong (the father), not his son.

Kedu_16_30,Grammar,0,A,C,"### ANSWER
C

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** suggests 한자어 can function as a prefix. While some Sino-Korean *characters* (e.g., 대-) act as prefixes, the term 한자어 refers to full Sino-Korean *words* (e.g., 대학), not prefixes themselves. This makes the statement misleading.  
- **Option B** claims 한자어 cannot combine with loanwords to form 혼종어 (hybrid words). However, 혼종어 specifically refers to combinations of *native Korean* and *Sino-Korean* words, not loanwords. The statement is technically true but trivial and not a notable property of 한자어.  
- **Option C** states that in the 국어사전, the number of native Korean noun entries exceeds that of 한자어 nouns. This is a well-established linguistic fact: native Korean vocabulary dominates the standard dictionary in quantity, especially for nouns.  
- **Option D** claims 한자어 cannot form redundant compounds with synonymous native words. This is incorrect, as examples like 산(山) + 산(내산) can create context-specific compounds, though rare.  

Thus, **C** is the only factually accurate and meaningful description."

A"
PSE_history_22_12,History,0,D,D,"The passage describes a leader of the Korean National Party who formed the Korean Independence Party to unify independence forces, led anti-Japanese efforts, returned after liberation to pursue government establishment, and traveled to Pyongyang with Kim Kyu-sik following the decision on South Korea's unilateral election. This clearly refers to **Kim Gu** (김구).  

- **Option A** mentions forming the Left-Right Joint Committee and announcing 7 principles, which occurred later in 1948 and involved broader participation, not solely attributed to Kim Gu as the primary actor.  
- **Option B** references An Jaehong, who died in 1909, making it impossible for him to collaborate post-liberation (1945), so this is factually incorrect.  
- **Option C** describes forming a military group in Hawaii, which aligns with figures like Kim Chwa-chung, not Kim Gu, who focused on political unification rather than armed struggle abroad.  
- **Option D** correctly states that upon the announcement of the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference decision (proposing a trusteeship for Korea), Kim Gu led the anti-trusteeship movement, including the February 8th Movement, which matches historical records of his resistance to foreign control.  

Thus, **D** is the accurate description of Kim Gu’s actions.

In example (ㄱ) 기 + 어 → 기여, the vowels 이 (i) and 어 (eo) combine to form 여 (yeo), a diphthong. In example (ㄷ) 배우 + 어 → 배워, the vowels 우 (u) and 어 (eo) combine to form 워 (wo), also a diphthong.

PSE_history_13_6,History,0,B,B,"To determine the correct chronological order of the historical events related to Korea’s Three Kingdoms period, we must analyze the timeline of each event:

- **ㄴ**: *백제가 고구려의 평양성을 공격하여 고국원왕이 전사 하였다.*  
  This refers to the Battle of 342 CE, when Baekje’s King Geunchogo defeated and killed Goguryeo’s King Gogugwon. This is the **earliest** event among the four.

- **ㄹ**: *고구려가 평양으로 도읍을 옮기고 백제의 수도 한성을 함락하였다.*  
  This describes two related events: Goguryeo moved its capital to Pyeongyang in **427 CE**, and later, in **475 CE**, captured Baekje’s capital Hanseong. The key date for this event is **475 CE**, after the move but the decisive moment is the fall of Hanseong.

- **ㄷ**: *신라가 대가야를 정복하면서 가야 연맹이 완전히 해체 되었다.*  
  This occurred in **562 CE**, when Silla fully conquered the Gaya Confederacy, leading to its dissolution.

- **ㄱ**: *백제가 신라의 대야성을 비롯한 40여 성을 빼앗았다.*  
  This happened **after 562 CE**, likely around **588 CE**, when Baekje, still recovering from earlier defeats, attempted to reclaim territories from Silla following Silla’s consolidation of Gaya.

### Chronological Sequence:
1. **ㄴ** (342 CE)  
2. **ㄹ** (475 CE)  
3. **ㄷ** (562 CE)  
4. **ㄱ** (post-562 CE, e.g., 588 CE)  

This matches **Option B: ㄴ→ㄹ→ㄷ→ㄱ**.

Other options are incorrect:
- **A** places ㄷ (562 CE) before ㄹ (475 CE), which is chronologically impossible.
- **C** and **D** begin with ㄹ, but ㄴ occurred earlier.

문제는 한국 민화(민화)에 대한 설명 중 **옳지 않은 것**을 찾는 것입니다. 각 선택지를 검토해 보겠습니다.

- **A 선택지**: ""민화에서 포도나 석류는 다산을 의미한다.""  
  포도와 석류는 한국 민화에서 다산(다수의 자녀)을 상징하는 것으로 잘 알려져 있습니다. 이 설명은 **정확합니다**.

- **B 선택지**: ""‘문자화’는 민화 장르의 하나다.""  
  ‘문자화’라는 용어는 한국 민화 장르 중에 존재하지 않습니다. 민화의 주요 장르로는 **책거리, 까치호랑이, 인간화, 사자화, 도깨비화** 등이 있습니다. ‘문자화’는 서예 또는 글자 그림을 의미할 수 있지만, 이는 민화의 공식 장르가 아닙니다. 따라서 이 설명은 **틀렸습니다**.

- **C 선택지**: ""‘까치호랑이’ 그림에서 호랑이는 백수를 상징한다.""  
  ‘까치호랑이’ 그림에서 호랑이는 **악령이나 위협**을 상징하며, 까치는 행운을 가져오는 상징입니다. 호랑이가 백수(일반인)를 상징한다는 설명은 **틀리지만**, 이 선택지는 “호랑이가 백수를 상징한다”고 주장하기 때문에 **정확히 오답이 아니며** 이 설명 자체는 **틀렸지만**, 문제에서 요구하는 “옳지 않은 설명” 중 하나로는 들어갈 수 있습니다. 그러나 더 기본적인 오답은 B입니다.

- **D 선택지**: ""‘책거리’ 그림은 책장, 책, 문방구 등을 그린 것이다.""

C  

**Reasoning:**  
The passage describes **이 왕** reacting to Dorim’s report about Baekje’s King Gaero’s oppressive policies by preparing to attack Baekje. Historically, this **이 왕** refers to a **Goguryeo king**, as Goguryeo was the primary rival of Baekje during this period. The key is identifying which option correctly describes an action attributed to this Goguryeo king.  

- **Option A** (moving capital to Pyongyang) is incorrect because Pyongyang became Goguryeo’s capital much later, under King Anjang (518–531 CE), not during the time of King Gaero (454–479 CE).  
- **Option B** (implementing 진대법) is not a documented policy of any Goguryeo king and appears historically unsupported.  
- **Option D** refers to defeating Japanese troops in Silla’s Nakdong River area, which aligns with Silla’s history (e.g., King Jabi), not Goguryeo’s actions.  
- **Option C** correctly states that the Goguryeo king **seized Nakrang County and drove out Han military forces**. This is a well-documented achievement of Goguryeo kings (particularly King Micheon and later kings), as they expanded into the Lelang Commandery remnants, including Nakrang, to secure territory and weaken Chinese influence. This action aligns with the aggressive posture of **이 왕** described in the passage, who sought to attack Baekje after learning of its internal weaknesses.  

Thus, **C** is the only historically accurate description of **이 왕**’s actions.

KIIP_law_17,Law,0,A,D,"### ANSWER  
D  

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks about the role of staff at immigration offices (출입국관리사무소) and customs (세관). These agencies are responsible for enforcing immigration and customs laws, which includes conducting investigations related to their specific jurisdictions (e.g., visa violations, smuggling).  

- **Option A** suggests they replace police in investigations, which is incorrect. Immigration and customs officers operate under separate legal frameworks and do not substitute police duties.  
- **Option B** (demanding punishment) and **Option C** (filing lawsuits) are roles of prosecutors or courts, not immigration/customs staff.  
- **Option D** (""수사를 지휘하는 것"" – directing investigations) accurately reflects that these officers **lead and conduct investigations** within their legal authority under the Immigration Control Act and Customs Act, such as inspecting documents, questioning individuals, and detaining violators.  

Thus, **D** is the correct answer.

PSE_history_14_3,History,0,B,D,"The statement emphasizes a geographical perspective where every region views itself as the center, challenging the Sinocentric worldview. This aligns directly with contributions related to cartography and mapping, as creating a map inherently defines a central perspective. Option D mentions the creation of *동국지도* (Map of Dongguk), which scientifically positioned Korea as the central focus, countering traditional Chinese-centric maps. This practical act of map-making embodies the philosophical argument presented in the question, making it the correct description of the scholar’s work. Other options focus on land distribution (B), cultural uniqueness (C), or historical geography texts (A), which do not as directly connect to the specific geographical centering argument provided.

**Reasoning:**  
The king who used the era name **준풍 (Junpung)** is **King Uijong of Goryeo** (reigned 1146–1170). The question states two of his achievements: **노비안검법 (Nobi Angeom Law)** and **관리의 복색 제정 (standardization of official clothing)**. Among the choices:  
- **A** refers to moving the capital to Ganghwa Island, which occurred much later during the Mongol invasions (under King Chungnyeol), not Uijong.  
- **B** mentions recovering the 쌍성총관부 (Sangsong Chunggwanbu), which relates to later resistance against the Mongols and is unrelated to Uijong’s reign.  
- **D** claims he first implemented the 과거제 (gwageo/examination system), but this was actually established earlier by **King Taejo of Goryeo** in 958.  
- **C** states he **지방에 12목을 설치했어요** (established 12 *mok* in the provinces). Historical records confirm that **King Uijong reorganized local administration**, including the establishment and reinforcement of the **12 *mok*** as part of his efforts to strengthen central control and administrative efficiency. This aligns with his reign and known reforms.  

Thus, **C** is the correct achievement of King Uijong."

- Choice A correctly identifies that the verb ""삼았다"" in (a) requires two additional sentence components (object and complement) besides the subject.
- Choice B correctly notes that ""바다가"" and ""눈이"" in (b) are subjects of different predicates (the main adjective ""파랗다"" and the adverbial phrase ""눈이 부시게"").
- Choice C correctly states that ""별을"" in (c) functions as the object of the main clause and there is no embedded clause involving ""안"" (the term ""안긴 문장"" here is misinterpreted but the analysis holds).
- Choice D incorrectly claims that ""좋은"" in (a) and ""반짝이는"" in (c) are predicates (서술어) of embedded sentences. In reality, both are adjectives modifying nouns (""기회"" and ""별"") and are not predicates of any clause.
- Choice E correctly identifies that both ""눈이 부시게"" in (b) and ""반짝이는"" in (c) function as modifiers (수식의 기능).

The question asks for the event corresponding to ""(가)"" in Korean history. Among the options:  
- **A: 경신환국** is not a widely recognized historical event in standard Korean history curricula.  
- **B: 기해예송** refers to a rebellion in the Gihae year (1728), but it is less commonly emphasized in exams.  
- **C: 병인박해** refers to the persecution of Catholics in 1866 (Byeongin year), a significant event, but the context of ""(가)"" likely points to a political convention rather than religious persecution.  
- **D: 을사사화** is the **Eulsa Convention** of 1905, where Korea was coerced by Japan into signing a treaty that surrendered diplomatic autonomy—a pivotal moment in Korean history often tested in exams. Given typical exam focus on Japan’s imperialistic actions during this period, **D** is the most appropriate match for ""(가)"".

**Reasoning:**  
The passage describes an incident where a Goryeo king adopted Yuan dynasty customs (braids and Hu clothing) but reverted after admonishment by official 이연종. This event is historically associated with **King Chunghye** (정혜왕), who reigned during the late Goryeo period and faced pressure from Yuan influence.  

Among the choices:  
- **Option C** mentions compiling military books like *동국병감* to prepare for Yuan invasions, aligning with King Chunghye’s efforts to strengthen defenses against Yuan dominance after resisting cultural assimilation.  
- Options A, B, and D relate to other kings (e.g., 과전법 in D is linked to King Gongmin), making them incorrect for this specific incident.  

Thus, **C** is the correct answer."

The question asks which revision opinion is **inappropriate** for correcting the draft. Each choice proposes a specific edit:  

- **A** suggests deleting **(ㄱ)** to maintain consistency in the *first paragraph*. However, **(ㄱ)** begins a **new paragraph** (after the introductory sentence about rising e-waste), so it is **not part of the first paragraph**. Deleting it for ""first paragraph consistency"" is logically flawed.  
- **B**, **C**, **D**, and **E** propose plausible edits (e.g., word choice, passive voice, paragraph order), which align with standard writing improvements.  
- **A** is the **only option** based on a misidentification of paragraph structure, making it the **inappropriate** suggestion.

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** is incorrect because judges in Korea can be dismissed not only through disciplinary proceedings but also via impeachment (Constitution Article 66), making the statement overly absolute.  
- **Option B** is incorrect: Supreme Court justices (대법관) serve 6-year terms **and can be reappointed**, contrary to the claim that reappointment is impossible.  
- **Option C** is incorrect: The Chief Justice (대법원장) is appointed by the President **upon recommendation of the Supreme Court (대법원)**, not a separate ""대법원장추천회의"" committee.  
- **Option D** accurately reflects the law: Judges other than the Chief Justice and Supreme Court justices serve **10-year terms** and **can be reappointed** as prescribed by law (Court Organization Act Article 24)."

The question asks which statement **inappropriately** describes the communication methods used in the interview conversation. Let’s evaluate each choice against the actual dialogue:

- **Choice A**: States the student confirms understanding through questions. This is accurate — the student asks follow-up questions (e.g., “이 그림은 누가 그렸는지도 아나요?”) to verify comprehension. **Appropriate**.
  
- **Choice B**: States the student shows engagement through positive reactions. This is accurate — the student exclaims “와! 있네요.” and “와! 지갑 속에 우주가 들어 있었군요.”, demonstrating active listening. **Appropriate**.

- **Choice C**: States the professor checks background knowledge before explaining. This is accurate — the professor asks “천 원권에는 어떤 그림이 그려져 있는지 알고 있나요?” to gauge prior knowledge before elaborating. **Appropriate**.

- **Choice D**: Claims the professor **recalls the student’s learning experience** to enhance delivery. However, the professor says: “국어 시간에 ‘용비어천가’를 배운 적이 있을 텐데요.” This is a **general assumption** (not a reference to the student’s actual personal experience). The student has not mentioned any prior learning, and the professor is simply using a common educational reference to introduce new information. The phrase “학생의 학습 경험 을 환기하고 있다” incorrectly implies the professor is **revisiting the student’s specific past experience**, which is not happening. This misrepresents the communication strategy. **Inappropriate**.

- **Choice E**: States the professor provides additional details upon request. This is accurate — when the student asks about the back of the 10,000 won note, the professor elaborates on the celestial chart. **Appropriate**.

### CONCLUSION  
Choice **D** is the only one that inaccurately describes the communication method, as the professor is **not** recalling the student’s actual learning experience but making a general educational reference.

The question asks which statement about constitutional amendments in South Korea is **incorrect**. Let’s evaluate each option against the constitutional procedure outlined in Article 130 of the South Korean Constitution:  

- **Option A**: States that constitutional amendments can be proposed by more than half of the members present in the National Assembly **or** by the President. This aligns with Article 130, which explicitly allows proposals by either the President or a resolution of more than half of the members present in the National Assembly. **Correct**.  
- **Option B**: Claims the National Assembly must decide on the amendment within 30 days of the proposal being announced. Article 130 specifies that the National Assembly must decide within 30 days of the proposal; if not, the proposal is considered passed. **Correct**.  
- **Option C**: States that after National Assembly approval, the amendment must go to a referendum within 30 days, requiring both a majority of votes cast **and** more than half of eligible voters (국회의원선거권자 과반수) to approve. This matches Article 130’s requirement for a referendum with these two conditions. **Correct**.  
- **Option D**: Claims the President must announce the proposed amendment for **more than 20 days**. However, the Constitution does **not** specify a 20-day announcement period for the President. After the National Assembly passes an amendment, it must be submitted to a referendum **within 30 days** (not 20 days), and the President promulgates the amendment **after** it passes the referendum—not during the proposal stage. The 20-day requirement is **not** part of the constitutional procedure. **Incorrect**.  

Thus, **Option D** is the **incorrect** statement.

**Reasoning:**  
The passage emphasizes the 오동나무 as a living witness to the passage of time and seasonal changes, with detailed descriptions of its growth from a small sapling to a towering tree that marks the narrator’s life stages (""해마다 이른 봄이면..."", ""그 잎사귀 서걱거리는 소리""). It serves as an experiential anchor for the narrator to perceive natural cycles and the flow of years. While the tree inspires the village’s nickname (choice D) and is metaphorically called a ""호사"" (luxury) of the poor village (choice B), these are secondary interpretations. Choice C incorrectly attributes planting to the mother, and E overstates the father’s intent. The core understanding is the tree’s role in grounding the narrator’s sensory and temporal experience, making A the best fit."

주어진 단어는 **저울**과 **비열**입니다. 각 선택지의 정당성을 검토해 보겠습니다.

- **선택지 A**: 각 단어 내의 자음의 조음 방법이 같다.  
  **저울**의 자음은 ㅈ(비음)과 ㄹ(유음)으로 조음 방법이 다르다. **비열**의 자음은 ㅂ(비음)과 ㄹ(유음)이므로 역시 다르다. 따라서 이 선택지는 틀렸다.

  **저울**의 ㅈ은 경구개 위치, ㄹ은 치골 위치로 다르다. **비열**의 ㅂ은 이입술 위치, ㄹ은 치골 위치로 다르다. 두 단어 모두 자음의 조음 위치가 다르기 때문에 이 선택지는 정답이다.

- **선택지 C**: 각 단어 첫 번째 음절의 모음은 혀의 높이가 서로 같다.  
  **저울**의 첫 음절 모음은 ㅓ(중간-낮음), **비열**의 첫 음절 모음은 ㅣ(높음)이므로 혀의 높이가 다르다. 따라서 이 선택지는 틀렸다.

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which option inappropriately applies the concepts of '직관ㆍ표상ㆍ사유' as defined in section (가). According to the context:  
- **직관** involves *sensory perception of given external objects*.  
- **표상** involves *inner imagination or recollection, independent of physical presence*.  
- **사유** involves *conceptual, logical understanding through pure thought*.  

**Option D** states:  
- ""예술의 새로운 개념을 설정하는 것은 사유를 통해"" (correct — conceptual establishment is 사유).  
- ""이를 바탕으로 새로운 감각을 일깨우는 작품의 창작을 기획하는 것은 직관을 통해"" — **incorrect**.  
Planning/creating art to ""awaken new senses"" is an *active, conceptual process* grounded in 사유 (applying the newly established concept), not passive sensory perception (직관). The context defines 직관 as *perceiving given objects*, not actively creating or planning works. Thus, labeling this as 직관 misapplies the category.  

Other options correctly assign:  
- **A**: Observing stars (직관) vs. recalling homeland (표상).  
- **B**: Both imagining futures/scenes are 표상.  
- **C**: Viewing a painting (직관) vs. analyzing it theoretically (사유).  
- **E**: Both regulating morality and proposing new criteria are 사유.  

Hence, **D** is the inappropriate application."

**Reasoning:**  
The author of (나) critiques Hegel by noting that while his dialectic *theoretically* positions art (intuition) as objective, the *actual progression* from art to philosophy shows objectivity diminishing and subjectivity increasing. Hegel states that Goethe and Schiller’s mature works achieve true artistic beauty only when their intellect is fully developed, implying art requires advanced subjectivity—contradicting its theoretical objective nature. Choice D directly captures this discrepancy: *“In theory, art, which has objectivity as its essence, in reality possesses subjectivity where objectivity has disappeared.”* This aligns with the author’s argument that the process from art (intuition) to philosophy erases objectivity and replaces it with subjectivity, failing to achieve true synthesis. Other choices misrepresent the core conflict between theory (objective art) and reality (subjective maturity in art)."

- **C** appropriately notes that (c) (patentability of robot tech) was used to predict intense competition in robot development, as reflected in (다)'s discussion of patent-driven market competition.  
- **D** correctly identifies that (d) (risks of falling behind in robot tech) was used to argue national loss from reduced robot demand due to tax, matching (다)'s explanation of import reliance.  
- **E** accurately states that (e) (expert opinions) was used to select the view that robot tax harms development, which is directly cited in (다).  
- **B** is **inappropriate** because (b) (historical cases of job loss from new machines but overall job growth) was used in (다) to counter job loss fears (as in choice A), **not** to argue robot tax is ""double taxation.""

The question asks which statement about ‘이 법’ (the law) is **incorrect**. The context describes a tax reform aimed at eliminating exploitation by intermediaries (모리배) in collecting bee honey taxes, already implemented in Gyeonggi and Gangwon, with plans to extend it to Chungcheong and Honam.  

- **Option A** states the law used land consolidation (토지 결수) as a tax standard. This aligns with historical tax reforms in Joseon that standardized taxation based on land surveys, making it plausible.  
- **Option B** claims the law was first implemented in Gyeonggi during King Injo’s reign. Historical records show tax reforms under Injo (1623–1649) targeted Gyeonggi first, matching the context’s description. This is likely correct.  
- **Option C** states that tribute to the royal family (왕실에 대한 진상) continued even after the law. Jinshang (진상) was a separate, entrenched practice unrelated to this tax reform, so it would logically persist. This is a correct statement.  
- **Option D** claims the law established **선혜청** (Seonhyecheong) as the responsible office. However, Seonhyecheong was a **central agency founded in 1391** to manage grain prices and relief, **not** a new office created for local tax reforms. The law described focuses on local implementation (Gyeonggi, Gangwon), which would involve local magistrates or hyangyak offices, **not** Seonhyecheong. Thus, this statement is **historically inaccurate**.

D

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which suffix in derived words has a different nature.  
- **A: 마개** uses the suffix **-개**, a nominalizing suffix forming concrete nouns (e.g., tool names like ""lid"").  
- **B: 우레** uses **-레**, a nominalizing suffix deriving nouns from verbs (e.g., ""우르다"" → ""우레"" for phenomena like thunder).  
- **C: 톱질** uses **-질**, a nominalizing suffix forming action nouns from nouns (e.g., ""톱"" → ""톱질"" for the act of sawing).  
- **D: 검댕** uses **-댕**, a **diminutive/affective suffix** that adds cuteness or informality (e.g., ""개댕""), differing from the nominalizing function of the others.  

Thus, **D** is the suffix with a distinct, non-nominalizing (affective) nature."

C"
PSE_history_16_13,History,0,A,D,"### ANALYSIS  
The passage describes a historical figure who:  
- Passed the **문과 (mun-gwa)** exam at age 34, beginning official service.  
- Suffered the loss of his mother and observed **3 years of mourning (상복)**.  
- Resumed official duties but retired to scholarly pursuits in **1546** (mid-40s) due to political turmoil (e.g., 을사사화).  
- Later served as magistrate of **풍기군 (Punggi County)** and successfully petitioned for the establishment of **소수서원 (Sosu Seowon)**, Joseon’s first officially recognized **사액서원 (saek-seowon)**.  

This matches **이황 (Yi Hwang, 1501–1570)**, a premier Neo-Confucian scholar of the Joseon dynasty. Key corroborations:  
- Yi Hwang passed the **문과** at **33–34** (historical records confirm 1534, age 33).  
- He mourned his mother’s death (1538) for 3 years.  
- He retired from active politics amid factional strife (e.g., 1540s purges) and dedicated himself to scholarship.  
- He was instrumental in establishing **Sosu Seowon** in Punggi (modern Gyeongsangbuk-do).  

**Evaluating the choices:**  
- **A**: Focuses on criticizing “서리 (local magistrates).” Yi Hwang was a scholar-official, but no historical record ties him to leading anti-corruption campaigns as described.  
- **B**: Claims “아홉 차례의 과거 시험에 모두 장원 (nine exam attempts, all first place).” This describes **김황원 (Kim Hwang-won)**, not Yi Hwang (who passed once).  
- **C**: States he “주희의 성리설을 받아들였으며, 이(理)의 절대성을 주장하였다 (accepted Zhu Xi’s theories and emphasized li’s absoluteness).” Yi Hwang **integrated Zhu Xi’s framework** but **rejected li’s absoluteness**, arguing **기 (qi) is equally vital**. This aligns more with his student **이이 (Yi I)**.  
- **D**: Describes his cosmology: “우주자연은 기(氣)로 구성되어 있으며, 기는 영원불멸하면서 생명을 낳는다고 보았다 (the universe is composed of qi, which is eternal and generates life).” This **directly reflects Yi Hwang’s philosophy**. He famously asserted **“기선설 (ki precedes)”**, emphasizing **qi as the dynamic, eternal force underlying all life and matter**—a cornerstone of his writings (e.g., *사상기*).  

**Conclusion**: Only **D** accurately reflects Yi Hwang’s cosmological views, consistent with historical records of his scholarship.

### ANSWER

PSAT_18_11,Law,0,C,D,"### ANSWER  
D  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** is correct under the South Korean Nationality Act: a child born in Korea with unclear parentage (e.g., unknown or unprovable nationality) acquires Korean nationality at birth.  
- **Option B** is correct: foreign individuals do not possess an inherent natural or constitutional right to choose a specific nationality under Korean law.  
- **Option C** is correct: while nationality arises with state formation, the dissolution of a state does not automatically cause loss of nationality (e.g., successor states determine nationality).  
- **Option D** is **incorrect**: While the Constitutional Court upholds the constitutionality of revoking Korean nationality upon voluntary acquisition of foreign nationality *for adults*, the act **does infringe** on the constitutional right to nationality (Article 12) and related freedoms. The court permits the infringement as a justified limitation, but the statement claims *no infringement occurs*, which is legally inaccurate. Thus, D is the erroneous assertion.

B

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which option groups words formed through the **same compound word formation process**.  

- **Option A (쌀밥, 작은집):** 쌀밥 is a **noun + noun** compound (쌀 + 밥), while 작은집 is an **adjective + noun** compound (작은 + 집). The processes differ.  
- **Option B (늦더위, 고무신):** Both are **noun + noun** compounds. 늦더위 combines 늦 (noun form of ""late"") + 더위 (""heat""), and 고무신 combines 고무 (""rubber"") + 신 (""shoe""). Both follow the same formation rule.  
- **Option C (들어가다, 굶주리다):** These are verbs, not noun compounds, and their formation involves verbal morphology, not standard noun compounding.  
- **Option D (젊은이, 부슬비):** 젊은이 is an **adjective + noun** compound (젊은 + 이). 부슬비 is also analyzed as **adjective + noun** (부슬 + 비), but standard linguistic classifications often treat 늦더위/고무신 as clearer, textbook examples of **noun + noun** compounds, while 부슬비’s structure can be ambiguous.  

**Option B** is the only pair where **both words unambiguously share the same formation process (noun + noun)**, making it the correct choice.

CSAT_korean_22_31,Textual,0,E,E,"The question asks for the option that is **inappropriate** based on the content of *박태보전*. The work portrays Pak Tae-bo as a moral hero who faces an unjust king, fails in his noble quest due to the corrupt world, but is recognized for his ethical duties to family and nation. Key narrative elements include his confession of guilt in a letter, the people's mourning, and critiques of the king's immorality through songs—not posthumous exaltation as a national restorer.

- **Option A** is appropriate: The dream (몽사) where Tae-bo's innocence is implied aligns with the wife's dream in the text, highlighting his moral standing.
- **Option B** is appropriate: Tae-bo's letter expressing regret over failing to repay the nation reflects his tragic failure against the king.
- **Option C** is appropriate: His letter wishing for reconciliation with his parents after death shows his enduring ethical responsibility.
- **Option D** is appropriate: The song contrasting the bright moon with the obscure king directly mirrors the text, showing public disapproval of the king's immorality.
- **Option E** is **inappropriate**: It claims ""편집자적 논평"" (editorial commentary) portrays Tae-bo as a hero who ""restored national fortune"" and gained public support. However, the text shows only mourning and no narrative or editorial endorsement of him as a restorer of national fortune; the story ends in tragedy with the king’s continued corruption and no redemption of the state.

Thus, E misrepresents the narrative by inventing a posthumous heroic legacy not present in the text.

**Reasoning:**  
The bracketed words in options B, C, and D (""느린"", ""큰"", ""높은"") are all **서술형 형용사** (descriptive adjectives) derived from verbs (느리다, 크다, 높다) and used in their attributive form to modify nouns. In contrast, the bracketed word in option A (""다른"") is a **자립형 형용사** (independent adjective), which stands alone without deriving from a verb and can function as a predicate directly (e.g., ""다르다""). This fundamental difference in grammatical origin and classification makes A the correct choice."

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** is incorrect because the consonant ‘ㄹ’ can appear in the initial position (e.g., 라면), and ‘ㅇ’ is a valid initial consonant representing a null sound (e.g., 아기).  
- **Option B** is false because Korean allows up to **two** consonants in the initial position (e.g., 브로), not just one.  
- **Option C** correctly describes a phonotactic restriction: in Korean, plosives (파열음: ㅂ, ㅍ, ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅎ) cannot be followed directly by nasal consonants (비음: ㅁ, ㄴ, ㅇ) within the same syllable’s final consonant cluster (e.g., no valid syllable ends with ㅂㅇ or ㅈㅇ).  
- **Option D** is incorrect because consonants like ‘ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ’ **cannot** be followed by certain double vowels (e.g., ‘ㅈㅑ’ or ‘ㅉㅕ’ are invalid in standard Korean orthography, despite ‘ㅈㅛ’ being valid).  

Thus, **C** is the only accurate statement."

- **Option C** (임병찬의 독립의군부, 1920) occurred after 1919.  
- **Option D** (조선 민립대학 기성회, established August 1919) occurred later in the same year, after the March 1919 movement, so it qualifies as ""after.""  
- **Option B** (정우회 선언) was proclaimed in **1918**, **before** the 1919 movement. Thus, it did **not** occur after ㉠ and is the incorrect choice.

Kedu_15_30,Grammar,0,A,A,"### ANALYSIS  
The question asks which options contain words in parentheses that are **한자어** (Sino-Korean words derived from Chinese characters). We evaluate each parenthesized word:  

- **ㄱ. (사과)**: ""사과"" (apology/regret) is composed of 사 (事) and 과 (果), making it a **한자어**.  
- **ㄴ. (걱정)**: ""걱정"" (worry) is a native Korean word (고유어), **not 한자어**.  
- **ㄷ. (칠판)**: ""칠판"" (blackboard) comes from 칠 (漆, lacquer) and 판 (板, board), forming 漆板 → **한자어**.  
- **ㄹ. (수발)**: ""수발"" (shoes and socks) is **not a 한자어**. While 발 (腳) is 한자어, 수 is not a standard Hanja component here; it is a native Korean element.  
- **ㅁ. (하물며)**: ""하물며"" (much less) is a native Korean adverb, **not 한자어**.  
- **ㅂ. (도대체)**: ""도대체"" (exactly/precisely) is composed of 도 (道), 대 (大), 체 (體) → 道大體 → **한자어**.  

Thus, the **한자어** cases are **ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ**.  

### MATCHING CHOICES  
- **A: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ** → Correct (matches 사과, 칠판, 도대체).  
- B, C, D include non-한자어 words (ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ).

D  

**Reasoning:**  
- Option A correctly describes 고유어 as having consonant and vowel alternation phenomena, which is a well-known characteristic.  
- Option B accurately states that 고유어 includes many grammatical function words (e.g., particles) and basic vocabulary, which aligns with linguistic facts.  
- Option C is correct because 고유어 is rich in expressive forms like 의성어 (onomatopoeia) and 의태어 (ideophones).  
- Option D claims that 고유어 has more words with single meanings compared to 한자어. However, 한자어 often derives from Chinese characters with relatively fixed, single meanings, while 고유어 words can carry multiple related meanings through usage. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.
