**Reasoning:**  
The elderly patient has uncontrolled hypertension (140/100 mmHg) due to non-adherence to medication. Immediate hospitalization (A) is unnecessary without acute symptoms. Explaining side effects (B) or increasing dosage (C) ignores the core issue of adherence. Registering for fee support (E) addresses cost but not compliance. The priority is assessing barriers to adherence, providing education, and monitoring compliance (D), which aligns with standard nursing practice for chronic disease management."

**Reasoning:**  
In nursing care for schizophrenia patients with delusions, arguing about the delusion (A, D, E) is inappropriate as it can increase anxiety and reinforce the belief. While showing interest in feelings (C) is empathetic, focusing on delusion content risks validation. The best practice is to avoid debating the delusion entirely (B), maintaining a calm, non-confrontational approach to build trust without reinforcing false beliefs.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient’s response (""점심을 먹고 바다가 파래, 자주색 김밥, 물고기 엄마..."") is disorganized and lacks logical coherence, reflecting **언어적 의사소통장애** (language communication disorder). This aligns with schizophrenia’s hallmark symptom of disorganized speech. Option A (급성 혼동) implies confusion about time/place/person, which isn’t evident. Options B, C, and E describe social, self-esteem, or violence risks—not directly observed here.

**Reasoning:**  
레보플록사신은 플루오록사신류 항생제로, 철분(예: 황산제일철)과 복용 시 흡수율이 감소하는 약물상호작용이 발생합니다. 철분 보충제는 레보플록사신과 최소 4시간 간격을 두고 복용해야 합니다. 다른 선택지인 수마트립탄, 토피라메이트, 에스오메프라졸, 아세트아미노펜은 레보플록사신과 상당한 상호작용이 없습니다. 철결핍빈혈이 있는 환자는 철분 보충제를 사용하고 있기 때문에 이와의 상호작용이 가장 중요합니다."

**Reasoning:**  
Candida krusei is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole and other azoles. Continuing or increasing fluconazole (options A, B, E) is ineffective. Flucytosine (C) carries high risk of toxicity in renal impairment (CrCl 46 mL/min), making it unsuitable. Echinocandins like micafungin are first-line for azole-resistant candidemia and are safe in renal dysfunction. Switching to micafungin addresses the resistance and clinical deterioration."

**Reasoning:**  
The scenario describes intentional use of muscle relaxants to feign disability and gain attention, which aligns with **factitious disorder** (B). Factitious disorder involves deliberate production of symptoms to assume the ""sick role"" and receive care/attention. Conversion disorder (A) involves unconscious neurological symptoms, illness anxiety disorder (C) focuses on health worries without intentional symptom fabrication, somatic symptom disorder (D) involves distressing symptoms without intentional production, and depersonalization/derealization disorder (E) relates to detachment from self/reality. Only factitious disorder matches the intentional behavior described.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 37 mL/min, indicating significantly reduced renal function (stage 3 chronic kidney disease). Fluconazole is primarily excreted renally, and dose adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity. While weight (58 kg) and age (52 years) are factors, the CrCl value is the critical parameter mandating dose reduction. There is no significant interaction between fluconazole and amoxicillin that would necessitate lower dosing. Thus, renal function (신장기능) is the primary reason.

**Reasoning:**  
For schizophrenia patients with paranoid delusions, arguing about the delusion (B, E) or reinforcing suspicious behaviors (D) worsens anxiety. Physical contact (A) may increase fear. Building trust through consistent, reliable actions—such as keeping promises—is a core nursing intervention to create safety and reduce isolation. This approach avoids confrontation while fostering a therapeutic relationship.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with neuropsychiatric symptoms (excessive suspicion, hallucinations, aggression) in Alzheimer’s disease. Atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine are indicated for managing severe behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia, including psychosis and aggression, despite risks. Gabapentin (A) is for seizures/pain, citalopram (B) and mirtazapine (D) are antidepressants not primary for psychosis, and nortriptyline (E) has anticholinergic risks that may worsen cognition. Quetiapine is the appropriate choice.

Option D encourages the patient to set realistic goals, which is therapeutic and promotes recovery by fostering a sense of accomplishment. Option A suppresses emotions, which is harmful. Option B isolates the patient, worsening depression. Option C overwhelms with large groups prematurely. Option E imposes excessive decision-making demands, increasing stress. Thus, D is the evidence-based approach.

양극성장애의 조증 환자는 자극에 대하여 민감하고 공격적일 수 있으므로, 간호사는 안전을 유지하기 위해 단호하고 중립적인 태도로 행동을 제한해야 합니다. 관찰만 하거나 논쟁을 하면 상황이 악화될 수 있으며, 경쟁적 활동이나 시끄러운 음악은 자극을 더욱 증가시킵니다. 중립적이고 결정적인 행동이 위협을 완화하고 안전한 환경을 조성하는 가장 적절한 접근법입니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has osteoarthritis and failed maximum-dose acetaminophen. Given her **CrCl of 28 mL/min (moderate renal impairment)**, NSAIDs (celecoxib, diclofenac) pose significant nephrotoxic risks and are generally contraindicated or require extreme caution. Tramadol (A) is not first-line for osteoarthritis due to addiction potential and side effects. Vitamin D (B) does not address acute pain. Duloxetine (C), an SNRI antidepressant, is **FDA-approved for osteoarthritis pain** and is a recommended alternative when NSAIDs are unsuitable due to renal or cardiovascular risks. It avoids renal toxicity and is appropriate here despite mild hypertension (BP 135/82 mmHg is acceptable).

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with obstructive symptoms (straining to urinate) and storage symptoms (urgency, incomplete emptying). First-line treatment for obstructive symptoms in BPH is an α₁-blocker, which relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow. Tamsulosin (B) is a selective α₁-blocker commonly used for this purpose. Dutasteride (E) reduces prostate size but acts slowly and is not first-line for acute symptom relief. Tolterodine (C) and oxybutynin (D) are anticholinergics for overactive bladder, not primary BPH treatment. Tadalafil (A) is for erectile dysfunction, not primary BPH management.

**Reasoning:**  
Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Its primary adverse effect is accelerated bone loss leading to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. Therefore, bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring via bone density testing (DEXA scan) is essential during treatment to assess and manage osteopenia/osteoporosis. Hearing tests (A) relate to ototoxic drugs, fecal occult blood tests (C) screen for colorectal issues, urea breath tests (D) detect H. pylori, and tuberculin tests (E) screen for TB—none are associated with letrozole’s side effects.

**Reasoning:**  
To apply goal management for reducing fall incidence, the nurse must first assess the current situation. Option C involves using a fall assessment tool to determine and record fall risk levels, which is the foundational step before setting goals, implementing interventions, or evaluating outcomes. Without initial risk assessment, goal setting (D) lacks data, and interventions (E) or reporting (B, A) cannot be effectively targeted. Assessment aligns with the nursing process and logical first step in any management strategy.

**Reasoning:**  
와파린은 시토크롬 P450 효소(CYP2C9 및 CYP3A4)를 통해 대사되며, 아미오다론은 이 효소를 강력히 억제하여 와파린의 농도를 증가시켜 출혈 위험을 높입니다. 따라서 아미오다론 투여 시 와파린 용량 조절이 필수적입니다. 가바펜틴, 알마게이트, 푸로세미드, 스피로노락톤은 와파린과 상호작용이 적거나 없으므로 용량 조절이 필요하지 않습니다."

**Reasoning:**  
수막내투여는 특정 암 치료에 사용되지만 신경독성 위험으로 제한적 사용이 필요합니다. 시타라빈, 메토트렉세이트, 히드로코르티손은 수막내투여가 안전하게 사용될 수 있는 약물입니다. 리포좀화시타라빈도 수막내 투여에 사용됩니다. 반면 **빈크리스틴**은 수막내투여 시 치명적인 신경독성을 유발하므로 반드시 정맥으로만 투여해야 합니다. 따라서 정답은 B입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
In nursing practice, verbal orders require immediate verification to prevent medication errors. The correct protocol involves writing down the order, reading it back to the prescriber for confirmation, and ensuring accuracy before administration. Option E aligns with standard safety procedures (""쓰고, 읽고, 재확인한다"" – write, read, reconfirm). Option A risks error without verification, B delays necessary pain management, C is not the primary step for verbal orders, and D shifts responsibility inappropriately without direct prescriber confirmation. Prioritizing patient safety through proper verification is essential."

**Reasoning:**  
The case describes severe carbon monoxide poisoning with COHb ≥40% and unconsciousness. The definitive treatment for severe CO poisoning is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (고압산소요법), which rapidly displaces CO from hemoglobin and reduces tissue hypoxia. Hemodialysis (A) is ineffective for CO poisoning. Thiosulfate (C) and pralidoxime (D) are used for cyanide/nerve agent poisoning, not CO. Sodium nitrite (E) is for cyanide poisoning to induce methemoglobinemia.

**Reasoning:**  
The scenario describes a researcher who performed an experiment under a germicidal lamp without protective goggles, leading to eye symptoms (redness, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, pain). Germicidal lamps primarily emit **자외선 (ultraviolet light, specifically UV-C)** for sterilization, which can cause acute eye irritation and photokeratitis. Gamma rays (A) are high-energy but not used in standard germicidal lamps. Infrared (C) emits heat, not causing these eye symptoms. Alpha particles (D) are ionizing radiation but not emitted by lamps. Radio waves (E) are non-ionizing and harmless at typical exposure levels. Thus, **자외선** is the correct answer.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient is delirious and unable to make decisions, and the cousin claims to be the guardian but may not be a legally authorized surrogate. The medical team believes the pneumonia is improving, so withdrawing life support based solely on one family member’s request without verification of authority risks ethical and legal complications. The appropriate step is to involve the hospital ethics committee to review the situation, assess decision-making authority, and determine the best course of action aligned with the patient’s best interests. Options A, B, and E do not address the conflict of surrogate authority directly, and C risks premature compliance without proper evaluation.

### Reasoning  
The scenario involves a potential living liver donation from a daughter who explicitly does not want to donate, and the wife attempts to influence the situation by requesting the doctor to falsely report unsuitability. In South Korea, living organ donations are strictly governed by ethical and legal frameworks requiring voluntary, uncoerced consent from the donor. The **장기등이식윤리위원회 (Organ Transplant Ethics Committee)** must review cases to ensure compliance with these standards, especially when there are conflicts of interest or potential coercion. Option C correctly mandates involving this committee for re-evaluation, as it is the proper channel to assess the daughter’s true wishes and uphold ethical guidelines. Options A, B, D, and E either bypass due process (e.g., ignoring the daughter’s refusal), risk falsification of results, or fail to address the ethical oversight required in such high-stakes decisions.

**Reasoning:**  
주어진 상황에서 1시간 동안 1L의 생리식염수로 방광 세척 후 배설량이 200mL로 매우 낮은 경우, 우선적으로 확인해야 할 것은 소변 배액관의 개존성입니다. 세척액이 방광에 주입되었지만 배출이 충분히 이루어지지 않았을 수 있으므로 배액관이 막히거나 잘 개존되지 않았는지 확인이 필요합니다. 세척액 주입속도 확인(A)은 주입 자체가 문제일 가능성을 배제하지 않지만, 배출량이 낮은 주요 원인은 일반적으로 배액관의 막힘입니다. 배액관 조절기 잠금(B)은 배출을 방해할 수 있으므로 부적절합니다. 1시간 후 재측정(C)은 문제 해결을 지연시킵니다. 배액주머니를 방광 높이까지 올리기(E)는 배출을 방해하므로 잘못된 조치입니다. 따라서 배액관의 개존성 확인이 최우선 중재입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
In cases of sexual assault within 72 hours, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), particularly **gonorrhea**. **Ceftriaxone** (250 mg IM single dose) is the first-line prophylactic agent for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. Permethrin (A) treats parasites, acyclovir (B) targets herpes viruses, fluconazole (C) is antifungal, and benzathine penicillin (E) treats syphilis but is not used for prophylaxis. Thus, **D** is correct."

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks about postmortem physical changes occurring **30 minutes to 1 hour after death**, relevant to nursing interventions for proper body positioning.  
- **사후시반 (Postmortem lividity)** begins **20–30 minutes after death** as blood pools due to gravity, becoming fixed within 8–12 hours. This is the **only change actively addressed within 30 minutes–1 hour** via repositioning to prevent pressure injuries or discoloration.  
- **사후한랭 (Algor mortis)** refers to body cooling, which occurs gradually over hours (not a positioning concern).  
- **사후강직 (Rigor mortis)** starts **2–6 hours postmortem**, outside the given timeframe.  
- **사후부패 (Putrefaction)** and **사후피부연화** occur days later.  

Thus, **A** is the correct answer."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with acute emotional distress, irritability, crying, insomnia, and loss of appetite following a severe medical diagnosis (osteosarcoma requiring amputation). These symptoms align with **adjustment disorder with depressed mood** rather than psychosis, anxiety-only, or mania. Mirtazapine (D) is an antidepressant that effectively addresses depressed mood, insomnia, and appetite loss—key features here. Zolpidem (A) only treats insomnia without addressing mood; valproate (B) is for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder, which isn’t indicated; buspirone (C) targets anxiety alone; haloperidol (E) is an antipsychotic for psychosis, which is absent. Mirtazapine’s sedating properties and appetite stimulation make it the most appropriate choice."

**Reasoning:**  
The newborn presents with jaundice starting at 24 hours, positive direct Coombs test, and blood type B (baby) vs. mother type O. This indicates **ABO incompatibility**, where maternal anti-B antibodies cross the placenta and cause hemolysis. Rh incompatibility (B) is excluded as both mother and baby are Rh(+). Physiological jaundice (C) typically has a negative Coombs test and peaks later. Breast milk jaundice (A) occurs after day 5 and Coombs is negative. Congenital hypothyroidism (E) shows abnormal TSH (normal here).

사지 신체보호대(억제대)를 적용할 때 뼈 돌출부위에 패드를 대주는 주요 목적은 피부 손상(예: 압통, 괴사, 압력괴양)을 방지하는 것입니다. 뼈 돌출부위는 압력이 집중되어 피부와 조직이 손상될 위험이 높기 때문입니다. 낙상, 질식, 근육수축, 관절구축 예방은 이와 직접적인 관련이 없습니다. 따라서 피부손상 예방이 가장 적절한 선택입니다.

The patient was bitten by a wild dog (들개) that could not be captured, indicating a high-risk exposure for rabies. For category III exposures (deep bites with visible damage), standard post-exposure prophylaxis requires both rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) to provide immediate passive immunity and active immunization. Option E combines both, while options C and D each provide only one component. Observation (A) is unsafe with an unobservable animal, and antihistamines (B) do not address rabies risk.

**Reasoning:**  
- Option A is incorrect because returning unused medication to the original bottle risks contamination.  
- Option B is unsafe as preparing medications in advance for the next shift increases error risks.  
- Option C is wrong because medication details should be recorded **after** administration, not before.  
- Option D correctly describes a standard safety protocol: double-checking dose calculations with a colleague prevents errors.  
- Option E misstates the ""five rights"" of medication administration; it should be **right patient**, not ""right nurse.""  

Thus, **D** is the only correct practice."

**Reasoning:**  
For women with a confirmed **BRCA1 mutation**, guidelines (e.g., NCCN, ACS) recommend **annual breast MRI** in addition to mammography due to high risk and dense breast tissue. Mammography alone is insufficient for early detection in this population. Tumor markers (B) are not screening tools, gamma imaging (A), CT (D), and PET (E) are not standard for routine breast cancer screening. MRI provides superior sensitivity in high-risk individuals.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient is experiencing ongoing seizures (status epilepticus) despite taking carbamazepine. First-line treatment for acute seizures in the emergency setting is a rapid-acting benzodiazepine to stop seizure activity promptly. Diazepam intravenous (IV) is a standard initial therapy for status epilepticus. Propofol, thiopental, and pentobarbital are second- or third-line agents used if benzodiazepines fail. Adding more carbamazepine is ineffective for acute seizure termination due to its slow onset of action. Thus, diazepam IV is the appropriate initial intervention.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with **acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms** (hallucinations, autonomic instability, history of heavy long-term use, and prior withdrawals). He is **12–16 hours post-last drink**, a critical window for **severe withdrawal** (e.g., delirium tremens). Immediate **detoxification** (해독치료) is required to prevent life-threatening complications like seizures or delirium tremens. Group therapy (A), social skills training (C), CBT (D), and craving antagonists (E) are **long-term interventions** and **not appropriate** for acute medical stabilization. Benzodiazepines (part of detox protocols) are first-line for withdrawal, aligning with **해독치료**.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has normal menstrual cycles, normal hormonal profiles (FSH, LH, estradiol, prolactin, TSH, testosterone), and normal semen analysis, ruling out options A (oligospermia), B (chronic anovulation), and E (PCOS, which typically shows irregular cycles, elevated LH/FSH ratio, or ovarian cysts). The retroverted, immobile uterus on pelvic exam combined with worsening dysmenorrhea strongly suggests **endometriosis** (자궁내막증), which causes pelvic adhesions, infertility, and dysmenorrhea. Option D (uterine adhesions) typically presents with amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea (Asherman’s syndrome), not dysmenorrhea. Pelvic ultrasound showing no ovarian masses does not exclude endometriosis, as laparoscopy is required for definitive diagnosis, which was performed per the question.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and presents with sudden chest tightness after receiving lidocaine. In a cardiac patient with acute chest pain, the immediate priority is to relieve potential myocardial ischemia. Sublingual nitroglycerin (option C) is the standard first-line treatment for acute angina or suspected myocardial ischemia, as it rapidly dilates coronary vessels. Administering epinephrine (option D) could exacerbate cardiac stress and is inappropriate without clear signs of anaphylaxis, which lacks supporting symptoms here. Ammonia inhalants (B) and hydrocortisone (E) are not indicated for cardiac chest pain, and intubation (A) is overly aggressive without respiratory distress.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with continuous vomiting and diarrhea, suggesting potential hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss. Key indicators of shock include **reduced urine output** (oliguria), as the body conserves fluid. Option D (배뇨량 20 mL/시간) is markedly low (normal is ≥30 mL/시간 for adults), signaling inadequate renal perfusion. Options A, B, C, and E represent normal vital signs or parameters (normal temperature, pulse, SpO₂, and capillary refill time), which do not indicate shock. Thus, D is the critical finding.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with the classic triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment) following subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ""magnetic gait"" (feet stuck to the floor) is characteristic of hydrocephalus. Parkinson’s disease typically includes hand tremors, which are absent here. Rebleeding would cause acute neurological deterioration, not progressive gait changes over months. Lewy body dementia is less likely without hallucinations or fluctuating cognition, and vascular contraction is not a standard diagnosis for these symptoms."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with extreme hyperthermia (40.2°C), altered mental status, dry skin, and muscle rigidity—classic signs of **heat stroke**. The markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK >12,000 U/L) indicates severe rhabdomyolysis, a common complication of heat stroke. Immediate **rapid cooling** is the critical first-line treatment to prevent organ damage and death. While supportive care (e.g., IV fluids) is also required, the provided options include **cooling blanket application (C)**, which directly addresses the life-threatening hyperthermia. Sedatives (A) could worsen CNS depression, hyperbaric oxygen (B) is for carbon monoxide/poisoning, muscle relaxants (D) do not treat the underlying cause, and glucocorticoids (E) are not indicated for acute heat stroke management.

**Reasoning:**  
The priority in this scenario is to assess the patient's stability due to sudden, significant bloody drainage (250 mL/hour), which may indicate active bleeding or hemorrhage. Measuring vital signs (D) is essential to detect signs of hypovolemic shock (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension) and guide urgent interventions. Clamping the drain (C) without assessment could worsen outcomes, while other options address non-urgent issues. Vital sign assessment aligns with the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) framework and is the foundational step before further action.

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with menopausal symptoms (sweating, flushing, insomnia) and laboratory findings indicating menopause (elevated FSH 55.0, low estradiol 5 pg/mL). However, she has a history of **breast cancer**, making estrogen-based therapies (options A, C, E) contraindicated due to the risk of stimulating cancer growth. Propranolol (B) is not indicated for menopausal symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, option D) are a well-established non-hormonal treatment for vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats) in breast cancer survivors, as they do not increase cancer risk and are safe for this population.

The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count, and markedly high lipase (664 U/L), which is diagnostic for acute pancreatitis. Chronic alcohol consumption (2–3 bottles of soju daily) is a primary cause, leading to premature **activation of digestive enzymes** (e.g., trypsin) within the pancreas, causing autodigestion and systemic inflammation. The elevated C-reactive protein (110 mg/L) reflects this severe inflammatory response. Other options are less likely: normal bilirubin and transaminases rule out bile stasis (A); no evidence of microbial infection or peritonitis (B); no signs of mechanical obstruction (C); and normal flora invasion (E) is typical in conditions like cirrhosis with ascites, which is absent here.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient with a 10-year history of diabetic nephropathy presenting with decreased urine output indicates acute worsening of renal function (acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease). Hypoglycemia may result from impaired insulin clearance due to reduced glomerular filtration. Serum creatinine, a marker of kidney function, typically **increases** as kidney function declines. Options A (GFR increase) and E (creatinine clearance increase) are incorrect because GFR and clearance decrease. Option B (serum urea nitrogen decrease) is unlikely, as urea nitrogen usually **increases** in renal failure. Option C (serum bilirubin decrease) is unrelated to acute renal deterioration. Thus, **D** is the expected finding."

테라조신은 알파 아드레날린 수용체 차단제로, 혈관 확장으로 저혈압을 유발할 수 있습니다. 특히 기립 시에 혈압이 급격히 떨어지는 **기립성 저혈압**은 서맥이나 실신 위험을 초래하므로 주의가 필요합니다. 다른 선택지 중 서맥(А)은 일반적이지 않으며, 소변량 감소(В)는 테라조신의 효과와 반대입니다. 백혈구 수치 증가(Ｄ)와 소변 내 질소 수치 증가(Ｅ)는 테라조신의 주요 부작용이 아닙니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The symptoms described—acute flaccid paralysis with vision loss, peripheral muscle weakness, and respiratory difficulty occurring a day after consuming contaminated sausage—are classic for **botulism**. Botulinum toxin acts by **inhibiting acetylcholine (ACh) release** at the neuromuscular junction, preventing muscle contraction. Choice C directly matches this mechanism. Other options are incorrect: A involves cell adhesion (unrelated), B relates to cAMP signaling (e.g., cholera), D affects inhibitory neurotransmitters (central nervous system, causing seizures), and E inhibits protein synthesis (slow, not acute paralysis). Botulism’s rapid onset and peripheral paralysis confirm C as correct."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient is an elderly individual (76 years) who underwent major abdominal surgery (right hepatectomy) 3 days prior and now presents with acute onset of confusion, disorientation (cannot recall name, place, date), agitation, and violent behavior—classic signs of **delirium**. Vital signs are stable, and there is no evidence of infection, metabolic derangements, or focal neurological deficits. Labs show only mild transaminase elevations (AST 65, ALT 77) with normal ammonia (25 μg/dL), bilirubin, electrolytes, and no abdominal tenderness, ruling out hepatic encephalopathy (A), acute liver failure, or intra-abdominal complications. Conversion disorder (B) typically involves focal neurological symptoms without global acute confusion. Seizure activity (C) would present with motor or sensory phenomena, not pure agitation/disorientation. Transient ischemic attack (E) causes focal deficits (e.g., weakness, aphasia), not global confusion. Postoperative delirium is common in elderly surgical patients and fits the clinical picture perfectly."

Option C indicates the patient plans to stop antihypertensive medication, which is dangerous and incorrect—medication should only be adjusted under medical supervision. Options A, B, D, and E reflect appropriate DASH diet understanding (nuts, reduced meat, whole grains, fruits/vegetables). Thus, C reveals a critical misunderstanding requiring further education.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with a large (15 cm), irregular, solid pelvic mass with ascites and markedly elevated tumor markers (CA 125 = 684 U/mL, CA 19-9 = 218 U/mL). These findings are highly suspicious for **ovarian cancer** (e.g., serous cystadenocarcinoma). Observation (A) is inappropriate for a suspicious mass of this size. Oral contraceptives (B) are not indicated for malignancy. Endometrial biopsy (C) targets the uterine lining, not an ovarian mass. Aspiration (D) risks tumor seeding and is unsuitable for solid masses. **Exploratory laparotomy (E)** is the standard initial management for suspected advanced ovarian cancer to confirm diagnosis, stage the disease, and initiate surgical treatment."

The patient presents with symptoms of organophosphate pesticide poisoning: miosis (small pupils), bradycardia (pulse 50/min), respiratory depression (low respiratory rate, elevated PaCO₂), and foaming due to excessive secretions. Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing cholinergic crisis. The definitive treatment is **atropine**, an anticholinergic agent that counteracts muscarinic effects. Morphine (A) is for pain, theophylline (C) for bronchodilation, benzodiazepines (D) for anxiety/seizures, and adrenal steroids (E) for inflammatory conditions—none address cholinergic toxicity. Atropine is the appropriate choice."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with dyspnea, low oxygen saturation (93%), and crackles indicating impaired gas exchange. The priority nursing intervention focuses on **airway and breathing** (ABCs). Maintaining a semi-Fowler position (앙와위 유지) optimizes lung expansion, improves oxygenation, and reduces work of breathing without risks like respiratory depression (unlike morphine). Chest physiotherapy (D) is important for secretion clearance but is secondary to immediate positioning for respiratory distress. Fluid restriction (A) and intake/output monitoring (E) are unrelated to acute respiratory prioritization. Morphine (C) is contraindicated due to potential respiratory depression in hypoxic patients.

**Reasoning:**  
인공호흡기로 호기말양압(PEEP)을 적용할 때는 흉강 내 압력이 증가하여 심장 전하량 감소로 혈압 저하가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 저혈압이 합병증으로 나타날 수 있습니다. 다른 선택지는 PEEP 적용 시 일반적인 합병증과 일치하지 않습니다. 예를 들어, 소변량 증가는 일반적으로 부정맥이나 부종에서 발생하지 않으며, 대사성 알칼리증은 호기말양압과 직접적인 연관성이 적습니다. 흉부 타진 시 탁음은 폐수종이나 유체 축적을 나타내고 호흡음 증가는 일반적으로 정상 호흡음이 아니므로 부적절합니다. 따라서 혈압 저하가 가장 적절한 답입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which phase II metabolic reaction is hindered by a deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids (e.g., cysteine, methionine). Glutathione conjugation (option E) directly depends on glutathione, a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine (a sulfur-containing amino acid), and glycine. A deficiency in sulfur-containing amino acids impairs glutathione synthesis, thereby hindering this conjugation pathway. Other options like glucuronidation (C) or glycine conjugation (B) do not primarily rely on sulfur-containing amino acids. Phosphorylation (A) is a phase I reaction, and glutamine conjugation (D) uses glutamine, which lacks sulfur.

For household contacts of active tuberculosis patients, the standard preventive therapy for latent TB infection (LTBI) is **isoniazid (INH) monotherapy for 6–9 months**, as recommended by CDC and WHO guidelines. Option D (same drugs as the patient) is incorrect because active TB treatment regimens are for active disease, not prophylaxis. Options C (ethambutol) and E (pyrazinamide) are not used for latent TB prevention. Option A (observation only) is inappropriate for high-risk contacts. Thus, **B** is the correct preventive measure."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient post-subarachnoid hemorrhage shows decreased consciousness, hypertension (190/100 mmHg), bradycardia (54 bpm), and a sharp decline in CSF drainage output (from 20 mL/hr to 2 mL/hr). This suggests possible increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to obstruction of the drainage system. The priority nursing intervention is to **verify the patency of the external ventricular drain (EVD)** to ensure proper CSF drainage and prevent further ICP elevation. Clamping the drain (E) would worsen ICP, thrombolytics (B) are contraindicated in hemorrhage, and sympathomimetics (C) could exacerbate hypertension. While elevating the head (A) is important for ICP management, confirming drain functionality is the most immediate action given the abrupt drop in output.

These symptoms are classic for a **transfusion allergy**, the most common transfusion reaction, typically mediated by IgE and presenting with urticaria within minutes to hours. Labs show **no evidence of hemolysis** (normal LDH, PT, aPTT, minimal urine RBCs), ruling out acute hemolytic reactions (B, C). There is **no respiratory distress** to suggest TRALI (A), and immunomodulation (E) causes long-term effects, not acute skin symptoms."

부종은 조직간 유체 축적으로 발생하며, 주요 원인 중 하나는 림프관의 폐쇄입니다. 림프관이 막히면 조직간 유체가 배출되지 않아 부종이 발생합니다. 혈장 알부민 증가는 유체 재흡을 촉진해 부종을 감소시킵니다(지원하지 않음). 모세혈관 정수압 감소는 부종을 줄이는 효과가 있습니다. 모세혈관 투과성 감소도 부종을 억제합니다. 세뇨관에서 나트륨 분비 증가는 체액 손실을 유발해 부종을 감소시킵니다. 따라서 정답은 A입니다."

B"
pharm_688,pharm,0,C,C,"### ANSWER  
C  

**Reasoning:**  
When cardiac output (심박출량) and peripheral vascular resistance (말초혈관저항) are chronically increased, blood pressure rises significantly (BP = CO × PR). Chronic hypertension triggers adaptive changes in arterial walls, primarily **동맥벽 비후 (arterial wall hypertrophy)**, as vessels thicken to withstand elevated pressure. Option A (맥압 감소) is incorrect because pressure increases. Option B (심근 위축) is unlikely; chronic increased workload typically causes cardiac hypertrophy, not atrophy. Option D (혈구용적 증가) relates to blood volume, not directly to sustained CO/PR elevation. Option E (혈관내 지질 축적) describes atherosclerosis, which is not a direct consequence of increased CO/PR. Thus, **C** is the best answer."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has heart failure (elevated BNP 380 pg/mL) and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.8%, glucose 170 mg/dL). SGLT2 inhibitors are specifically indicated for both heart failure reduction (as per recent guidelines) and diabetes management. They improve outcomes in heart failure and are safe even with reduced renal function. Other options are less appropriate: insulin (A) is for acute hyperglycemia, sulfonylureas (B) risk hypoglycemia and fluid retention, thiazolidinediones (C) cause fluid retention worsening HF, and DPP-4 inhibitors (E) lack strong HF benefits.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with symptoms classic for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): irregular menstrual cycles, bilateral ovarian enlargement, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. In PCOS, there is typically an **increase in luteinizing hormone (LH)** due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysregulation, which drives ovarian androgen production. Androgen levels are elevated (ruling out B), insulin is often elevated due to resistance (ruling out A), estrogen may be normal or slightly elevated but not decreased (ruling out C), and progesterone is low due to anovulation (ruling out D). Thus, the correct hormonal change is **LH increase**.

The presentation (young woman with multiple sexual partners, fever, lower abdominal pain, vomiting, purulent discharge, cervical/adnexal tenderness) is classic for **pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**. First-line management of PID is **broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy** to cover common pathogens (e.g., *Chlamydia*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*). Options A (oophorectomy) and D (uterine artery embolization) are surgical interventions reserved for complications (e.g., abscess), not initial treatment. Option B (leg elevation) is irrelevant. Option E (Shirodkar repair) is for cervical incompetence in pregnancy, not PID. Thus, **C** is correct."

The question involves a young woman with a strong family history of breast cancer (mother and grandmother), indicating a hereditary risk. The primary genes associated with hereditary breast cancer are **BRCA1** and **BRCA2**. Among the options, **BRCA1 (C)** is the most relevant for assessing hereditary breast cancer risk. APC is linked to colorectal cancer, BCL2 to lymphomas, MYC to various cancers but not specifically hereditary breast cancer, and RB1 to retinoblastoma. Thus, **C** is the correct choice.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with vulvar itching, swelling, redness, and white ""cottage cheese-like"" discharge—classic signs of **vulvovaginal candidiasis** (yeast infection). Diabetes (especially poorly controlled) is a major risk factor for candidiasis due to elevated glucose in vaginal secretions. **Fluconazole (B)** is the first-line oral treatment for acute uncomplicated candidiasis.  
- **A (Estrogen)** is used for menopausal symptoms, not infections.  
- **C (Doxycycline)** and **E (Ciprofloxacin)** are antibiotics for bacterial infections (e.g., PID, chlamydia), not yeast.  
- **D (Metronidazole)** treats bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, which present with grayish/fishy discharge, not white cottage cheese discharge.  

**Conclusion:** Fluconazole is the appropriate antifungal agent.

**Reasoning:**  
The non-stress test (NST) assesses fetal well-being by monitoring heart rate responses to movements. A healthy fetus shows **accelerations**—a rise in heart rate (>15 bpm for >15 seconds) coinciding with movements (choice D). Choice A is incorrect because normal fetal heart rates are 110–160 bpm. Choices B and C describe decelerations (delayed/variable), which indicate distress. Choice E shows absent accelerations, also abnormal. Thus, D is the only sign of fetal health.

**Reasoning:**  
The clinical findings (limited hip external rotation, asymmetric inguinal folds, and differing knee heights when hips are flexed) are classic for **developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)** in a newborn. For infants **under 6 months**, **ultrasound** is the gold-standard imaging modality to evaluate DDH because it visualizes cartilaginous structures not visible on X-ray. X-ray (B) is less effective in this age group due to immature ossification centers. Biopsy (C) and arthroscopy (D) are invasive and inappropriate for initial diagnosis. Bone scan (E) is used for infection or trauma, not DDH screening. Thus, **ultrasound (A)** is the correct next step."

**Reasoning:**  
The question involves interpreting BMI calculated from survey-collected weight and height data. Since the data relies on self-reported measurements via surveys (not direct physical measurements), **measurement bias** arises from potential inaccuracies in participants' self-reported values (e.g., rounding, underreporting weight, or overreporting height). This directly affects the validity of the BMI calculations. Other biases like selection bias or attrition bias are not primarily tied to the *method of data collection* itself, which is the core issue here.

**Reasoning:**  
The question describes numerous studies over 50+ years with varying subjects, methods, and time points, yet results remained similar. This aligns with the **consistency** criterion for causality—consistent findings across diverse studies strengthen the evidence for a causal relationship. While temporal relationship (D) and biological plausibility (E) are also causality criteria, the emphasis on **similar results despite methodological differences** specifically highlights consistency (C). Experimental proof (A) is often impractical for ethical reasons (e.g., manipulating cholesterol levels), and strength of association (B) refers to effect size, not reproducibility.

His occupation involves non-destructive testing, which commonly uses **ionizing radiation** (e.g., X-rays or gamma rays). Ionizing radiation damages rapidly dividing cells like hematopoietic stem cells, leading to such hematologic abnormalities. UV (A), infrared (B), extremely low frequency (D), and radio waves (E) are non-ionizing and do not cause this level of bone marrow suppression.

**Reasoning:**  
The symptoms began approximately 3 hours after consuming kimchi at lunch, which aligns with the short incubation period (1–6 hours) of **포도알균 (Staphylococcus aureus)** food poisoning. This bacterium produces preformed enterotoxins that cause rapid vomiting and abdominal pain. Other options like 살모넬라 (C) or 시겔라 (B) typically have longer incubation periods (12+ hours to days), making them less likely. The rapid onset and group exposure strongly point to toxin-mediated food poisoning by *Staphylococcus aureus*.

**Reasoning:**  
The child exhibits **퇴행 (regression)** by seeking comfort through familiar items (home pajamas and spoon) during hospitalization stress. Regression involves reverting to earlier behaviors for emotional security. Other options don’t fit: 거부증 (refusal) implies outright rejection, 의식주의 (obsessive-compulsive) involves compulsive rituals, 분노발작 (tantrum) requires anger outbursts, and 애착장애 (attachment disorder) involves inability to form bonds—not seeking home comforts.

**Reasoning:**  
The BCS Class 1 drugs are defined by **high solubility and high permeability**. For these drugs, the dissolution rate is rapid and complete, and absorption is not rate-limited by membrane permeability. This allows **comparative dissolution testing** to predict in vivo performance reliably, meaning **biochemical equivalence testing can be replaced by dissolution studies**. Option D correctly states this. Option B describes Class 2 (low solubility, high permeability), and other options misrepresent Class 1 characteristics."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with persistent vomiting and abdominal bloating for 1 month, with a history of suspected gastric ulcer on prior upper GI series. Current symptoms and physical findings (upper abdominal tenderness without rebound) suggest ongoing upper gastrointestinal pathology. While antacids were used, persistent symptoms warrant definitive diagnostic evaluation. Upper GI series is less sensitive than direct visualization. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) allows direct assessment of the ulcer, evaluation for healing, complications (e.g., bleeding, perforation), and biopsy for malignancy or H. pylori. Urea breath test (B) screens for H. pylori but does not visualize the ulcer. Abdominal CT (C) is less sensitive for mucosal lesions. Esophageal manometry (A) assesses motility disorders, not indicated here. Laparoscopy (E) is invasive and reserved for cases where imaging is inconclusive. EGD is the standard next step."

**Reasoning:**  
생후 2일 된 신생아가 태변을 보지 못하고 담즙이 섞인 구토, 복부팽만, 수유거부를 보일 때는 **선천거대결장(Hirschsprung 질환)**이 예측됩니다. 이 질환은 결장의 신경세포가 부족하여 장 기능이 방해되어 태변 배출이 지연되고 복부팽만, 담즙구토가 발생하는 특징이 있습니다. 배꼽탈장은 복부팽만은 가능하지만 담즙구토는 흔하지 않으며, 담도폐쇄는 담즙이 혼잡된 증상을 주지만 태변 부재와 직접적 연관은 적습니다. 식도기관루는 수유 시 코UGH나 질식 증상이 주 증상이며 담즙구토는 일반적이지 않습니다. 비대유문협착은 유문부의 협착을 의미하지만 선천거대결장이 더 정확한 진단입니다.

The infant presents with vomiting, frequent diarrhea, and significant weight loss over 3 days, indicating **severe dehydration**. Key dehydration signs in infants include **sunken fontanelle (대천문 함몰)** due to reduced intracranial fluid. Option A (hypothermia) is not typical; B (moist mucous membranes) contradicts dehydration (membranes are usually dry); D (increased urine output) is incorrect as output decreases; E (capillary refill ≤2 seconds) reflects normal perfusion, not dehydration. Sunken fontanelle is a classic dehydration indicator.

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks for an innate immune element crucial for defense against bacteria. Innate immunity includes non-specific defenses like phagocytes.  
- **A (호산구):** Eosinophils primarily combat parasites and are involved in allergic responses, not bacteria.  
- **B (IgM항체):** IgM is an antibody, part of **adaptive** immunity, not innate.  
- **C (큰포식세포):** Macrophages are key phagocytic cells in innate immunity that engulf and destroy bacteria directly.  
- **D (1형인터페론):** Type 1 interferons are antiviral and not primarily bacterial defense.  
- **E (세포독성T세포):** Cytotoxic T cells are adaptive immune cells targeting infected host cells, not innate.  
Thus, **C** is the correct innate immune component for bacterial defense."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has a severe hypertension (BP 225/130 mmHg) on acute ischemic stroke diagnosis. Thrombolytics like alteplase (D) are contraindicated when BP exceeds 185/110 mmHg. Immediate blood pressure control is required before any reperfusion therapy. Labetalol (B) is first-line for rapid, controlled BP reduction in acute stroke settings. Heparin (A) is not indicated without atrial fibrillation evidence, diltiazem (C) is less preferred, and nitroglycerin (E) is typically for cardiac ischemia. Thus, labetalol is the priority."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with an acute COPD exacerbation featuring **purulent sputum**, indicating a likely bacterial infection. Guidelines (e.g., GOLD) recommend **antibiotics** for exacerbations with increased sputum purulence. Azithromycin (E) is a guideline-supported oral antibiotic for such scenarios. Options A (additional LABA) and B (inhaled steroid) are inappropriate during acute exacerbation (systemic steroids are already being used, and adding another LABA offers no acute benefit). Montelukast (C) and roflumilast (D) are not indicated for acute treatment.  

### ANSWER  
E"
pharm_774,pharm,0,D,D,"### ANSWER  
D  

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has COPD with FEV1 at 60% predicted (moderate severity) and a high CAT score of 18, indicating poorly controlled symptoms. Current therapy is monotherapy with aclidinium (a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, LAMA). According to GOLD guidelines, for patients with symptomatic COPD (CAT ≥10) on LAMA monotherapy, the next step is to add a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) to form a LAMA/LABA combination. Option D replaces aclidinium monotherapy with formoterol/aclidinium (a LABA/LAMA combo), which is appropriate. Option E adds an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which is reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations or eosinophilia, not indicated here. Options A, B, and C (adding ICS, roflumilast, or azithromycin) are not first-line for symptom control without exacerbation history.

The patient has moderate-to-severe extensive ulcerative colitis unresponsive to prednisolone. Guidelines recommend biologic therapy (e.g., anti-TNF agents like infliximab) for induction of remission in steroid-resistant cases, often combined with azathioprine for maintenance. Budesonide (A) is unsuitable for extensive disease. Tacrolimus (B) and methotrexate (C) are not first-line for UC. Vedolizumab + tofacitinib (D) is atypical; infliximab + azathioprine (E) is standard."

The question describes a scenario where a community health nurse coordinated with a social welfare organization to provide free artificial joint replacement surgery for a patient with degenerative arthritis. The key resource utilized here is the **service and expertise provided by the organization**, which falls under **인적 자원 (human resources)**. Human resources refer to people, skills, and organizational capacity that support community services.

**Reasoning:**  
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) post-stent implantation, guidelines recommend **dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** for at least 12 months to prevent stent thrombosis. The standard DAPT regimen consists of **aspirin plus a P2Y₁₂ inhibitor**. Among P2Y₁₂ inhibitors, **ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily)** is preferred over clopidogrel in acute coronary syndromes (like STEMI) due to superior efficacy and faster onset. Option C correctly pairs aspirin (100 mg daily) with ticagrelor at the appropriate maintenance dose. Option E is incorrect because clopidogrel’s maintenance dose is **75 mg daily**, not 300 mg (which is a loading dose). Options A, B, and D use non-standard agents (dipyridamole, apixaban, cilostazol) not recommended for routine post-stent DAPT in STEMI.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73m² (CKD stage 3b). Saxagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, requires dose reduction when eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m². The current dose of 5 mg daily should be reduced to 2.5 mg daily. Other drugs like losartan (ARBs are safe in CKD ≥30), hydrochlorothiazide (may be used but less effective; no specific dose reduction guideline at eGFR 40), lobeglitazone (TZDs require caution in severe renal impairment but not dose reduction at eGFR 40), and rosuvastatin (dose ≤5 mg is appropriate for eGFR 30–49) do not mandate dose reduction here.  

### ANSWER  
B"
pharm_783,pharm,0,C,C,"### ANSWER

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has chronic kidney disease with anemia (Hgb 9.8 g/dL) and laboratory evidence of **iron deficiency** (ferritin 74 ng/mL < 500 ng/mL; Tsat 16% < 30%). He previously used oral ferrous sulfate but discontinued due to severe heartburn, indicating **intolerance to oral iron**. In chronic kidney disease, intravenous iron (e.g., iron sucrose) is the appropriate next step to replenish iron stores before considering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (like epoetin alfa). Transfusion (A) is unnecessary as Hgb is not critically low, testosterone (B) is irrelevant, and L-carnitine/vitamin C (E) does not address iron deficiency directly.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient shows signs of acute cellular rejection (decreased urine output, pain) one month post-transplant with negative donor-specific antibodies, ruling out antibody-mediated rejection. First-line treatment for acute cellular rejection is high-dose corticosteroids like methylprednisolone. Rituximab targets B-cells (used in antibody-mediated rejection), basiliximab is for induction therapy, tocilizumab is not standard for transplant rejection, and mizoribine is a maintenance immunosuppressant. Methylprednisolone is the appropriate initial therapy.

The transtheoretical model identifies stages of change: pre-contemplation (no plan to change), contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. A person with **no quit plan within 6 months** is in **pre-contemplation**. In this stage, the appropriate intervention is **education about the need to quit** to raise awareness and encourage movement toward contemplation. Options A, B, D, and E are interventions for later stages (action/preparation). Thus, **C** is correct."

The patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), requiring immediate discontinuation of heparin. Argatroban (E) is a direct thrombin inhibitor specifically approved for anticoagulation in HIT and is the standard alternative. Warfarin (A) is contraindicated acutely in HIT due to pro-thrombotic risk. Edoxaban (B) is a DOAC but not first-line for acute HIT management. Prasugrel (C) and ticlopidine (D) are antiplatelet agents, not anticoagulants, and are inappropriate for treating HIT-related thrombosis.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has worsening glycemic control (HbA1c risen to 6.8%) and progressive chronic kidney disease (eGFR declined from 53 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m², ACR increased from 13 to 45 mg/g). Current therapy includes glimepiride (a sulfonylurea), which may contribute to renal strain and lacks kidney-protective benefits. Guidelines strongly recommend SGLT2 inhibitors (like dapagliflozin) for type 2 diabetes management in patients with eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m² and kidney disease, as they improve glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular risk, and slow CKD progression. Metformin is typically first-line but is already indicated; however, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor is prioritized here due to renal decline. Other options lack equivalent renal protection: voglibose (α-glucosidase inhibitor) has minimal renal benefit, repaglinide adds hypoglycemia risk, and lobeglitazone (thiazolidinedione) may worsen edema in CKD.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with recurrent, brief episodes of acute dyspnea and chest tightness that resolve spontaneously, with normal cardiac and pulmonary investigations. This pattern is classic for **panic attacks** associated with **panic disorder**. Panic disorder is commonly treated with **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** like **escitalopram** (option C) for long-term management and prevention. Buspirone (A) is used for generalized anxiety, not acute panic; theophylline (B) is for asthma; procyclidine (D) is an anticholinergic for Parkinsonism; nitroglycerin (E) treats cardiac ischemia, which is ruled out by normal tests. Escitalopram is the appropriate first-line treatment for panic disorder."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with bilateral conjunctivitis, starting in one eye and spreading, with severe follicular hypertrophy and a thin pseudomembrane on slit-lamp examination. These findings are characteristic of **Chlamydia trachomatis** infection (클라미디아결막염). The history of similar symptoms in the husband suggests possible sexual or close-contact transmission, which aligns with chlamydial conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis (B) typically lacks pseudomembranes and often has watery discharge, while allergic conjunctivitis (E) features itching without follicles or pseudomembranes. Bacterial conjunctivitis (not listed explicitly) usually shows purulent discharge without prominent follicles. Simple follicular conjunctivitis (C) is milder and lacks pseudomembranes. Thus, **D** is the correct diagnosis."

**Reasoning:**  
For hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose is first-line therapy. When insufficient, rifaximin (an antibiotic) is the recommended adjunctive agent to reduce ammonia-producing gut bacteria. Lactitol (A) is similar to lactulose but not standard second-line. Flumazenil (C) treats benzodiazepine overdose, not HE. Metronidazole (D) is an alternative antibiotic but less preferred due to side effects. Spironolactone (E) manages ascites, not encephalopathy. Thus, rifaximin is the correct addition.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c 9.0%) and severe hypertension (160/100 mmHg). Dental procedures can induce physiological stress, potentially worsening glycemic control or causing cardiovascular events. Standard guidelines recommend consulting or referring to an internist to optimize these conditions before invasive dental treatment to minimize risks. Option A is unsafe due to uncontrolled systemic diseases. Option C is incorrect because antibiotics may be indicated in certain cases (e.g., infection risk in diabetics). Option D is wrong—acetaminophen is generally safe. Option E is dangerous as high-epinephrine anesthetics can exacerbate hypertension. Thus, B is correct."

For a schizophrenia patient diagnosed with ""risk of violence towards others,"" the priority is to establish safety through structured, therapeutic boundaries. Competitive group therapy (A) may increase agitation, loud music (B) can heighten arousal, and crowded environments (C) risk overstimulation. While 24-hour restraint prevention (E) seems protective, restraints are a last resort due to ethical and safety concerns.

The patient exhibits chronic obsessive-compulsive symptoms (excessive time spent organizing items by specific rules, distress when order is disrupted), indicating OCD. First-line pharmacotherapy for OCD involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the options, **paroxetine (C)** is an SSRI approved for OCD treatment. Naltrexone (A) treats addiction, tiapride (B) is an antipsychotic, bupropion (D) is an antidepressant/NRI, and alprazolam (E) is a benzodiazepine for acute anxiety—not first-line for OCD due to dependence risk. Thus, paroxetine is the appropriate choice.

The patient has type 2 diabetes with an elevated HbA1c (8.2%) despite metformin and linagliptin. When initiating insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes, basal insulin (long-acting) is typically first-line to control fasting glucose and reduce hypoglycemia risk. Insulin glargine is a basal insulin, making it appropriate.

**Reasoning:**  
The infant has persistent diarrhea occurring **within 30 minutes of formula feeding**, with mucus, following a recent **rotavirus infection**. This presentation is classic for **secondary lactose intolerance** due to transient lactase deficiency post-viral gastroenteritis. Formula (which contains lactose) triggers rapid osmotic diarrhea. The correct intervention is to switch to **lactose-free formula (무젖당분유)** to eliminate the offending substrate.  

- **A (모유 중단)**: Unnecessary; breast milk is safe and continues to provide benefits.  
- **B (이유식 중단)**: Solids were introduced 6 weeks ago; symptoms are formula-linked, not solids.  
- **C (수분섭취 제한)**: Dangerous; infants require adequate hydration during diarrhea.  
- **E (수유모 항원제한식사)**: Relevant for cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA), but symptoms are acute post-formula and lack other CMPA signs (e.g., eczema, blood in stool).  

Lactose-free formula (D) directly addresses the pathophysiology.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with primary hypogonadism (low testosterone, elevated LH/FSH after GnRH stimulation, small testes, gynecomastia, and delayed puberty). Key features like tall stature, gynecomastia, and elevated gonadotropins suggest Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), a common cause of primary testicular failure. Karyotype testing is the definitive diagnostic method for confirming chromosomal abnormalities like Klinefelter syndrome. Growth hormone (A) is unrelated to the hormonal profile.

**Reasoning:**  
칸데사르탄은 안지오텐신 II 수용체 차단제(ARB)로, 임신 중에는 태아 신장 발달 장애, 저산소증 등의 위험을 초래하여 금기입니다. 임신 계획 시에는 안전한 약물로 전환해야 합니다. 라미프릴(ACE 억제제)과 아테놀롤(베타차단제 중 일부)는 또한 임신에 부적합합니다. 니페디빈(칼슘 채널 차단제)은 임신 중 고혈압 치료에 안전하게 사용되는 약물 중 하나입니다. 히드로클로로티아지드(티아지드 이뇨제)는 임신 중 사용에 주의이 필요하지만, 니페디빈이 더 선호되는 선택입니다. 따라서 칸데사르탄을 니페디빈으로 변경하는 것이 적절합니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with severe pancytopenia (Hb 6.5 g/dL, WBC 1,300/mm³, platelets 7,000/mm³) and a hypocellular bone marrow (cellularity 10%, blasts 1.2%). This is diagnostic of **aplastic anemia**. In older patients (≥60 years), the first-line treatment is **immunosuppressive therapy** (e.g., antithymocyte globulin + cyclosporine), not stem cell transplantation (which is preferred in younger patients). Glucocorticoids (A) and IV immunoglobulin (D) are used for immune thrombocytopenia, not aplastic anemia. Induction chemotherapy (C) is for acute leukemias, which is not indicated here.

### Reasoning  
The patient presents with **seasonal cough and dyspnea** (worsening in March, improving in summer) in a young non-smoker, with **mild obstructive pattern on pulmonary function tests** (FEV1/FVC 77%) and **elevated eosinophils (7%)**. These findings strongly suggest **allergic asthma**, especially given the seasonal pattern (likely pollen exposure). The bronchodilator response is minimal (FEV1 improves from 82% to 84% predicted), which is common in early or mild asthma when baseline obstruction is subtle.  

- **Option A (Echocardiogram)**: Unnecessary, as there are no cardiac signs or symptoms.  
- **Option B (Bronchoscopy)**: Invasive and not indicated without suspicion of infection, hemorrhage, or structural lung disease.  
- **Option C (Sinus X-ray)**: Irrelevant; no sinus symptoms reported.  
- **Option D (Bronchial provocation test)**: **Critical** for diagnosing asthma when baseline PFTs are near-normal but clinical suspicion is high. This test (e.g., methacholine challenge) detects airway hyperresponsiveness.  
- **Option E (Chest CT)**: Unwarranted, as chest X-ray and auscultation are normal, and there is no indication of interstitial or parenchymal disease.  

**Bronchial provocation testing is the appropriate next step** to confirm asthma in this seasonal, eosinophilic presentation.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, making benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) contraindicated due to high abuse potential. First-line treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are SSRIs/SNRIs like duloxetine, which lack abuse risk and are effective for chronic management. Buspirone is an alternative but is not first-line, while quetiapine and hydroxyzine are not primary GAD treatments. Duloxetine is appropriate and safe given the patient’s history.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has Parkinson’s disease with persistent hallucinations despite discontinuing rasagiline and ropinirole and reducing levodopa. Hallucinations in Parkinson’s disease often require antipsychotic treatment that does not worsen motor symptoms. Haloperidol (D) and other typical antipsychotics are avoided due to dopamine blockade exacerbating motor symptoms. Amantadine (A) treats dyskinesia, not psychosis. Atomoxetine (B) is for ADHD, and ethosuximide (E) is for seizures. Quetiapine (C), an atypical antipsychotic with minimal dopamine D2 receptor affinity, is preferred for managing psychosis in Parkinson’s disease without significantly impairing motor function.

**Reasoning:**  
이 환자는 중등도에서 중증의 담배 의존증을 보이며, 금연 시 불안과 금단 증상을 경험하여 빠르게 재흡연한다. 담배 금연 치료의 첫선은 니코틴 대체요법(NRT)이나 약물로 **바레니클린(Varenicline)**이 가장 효과적이다. 바레니클린은 α4β2 니코틴 수용체의 부분 작용제로, 금단 증상과 욕구를 감소시키며 재흡연률을 낮추는 데 효과적이다. 벤라팍신(부피라민)은 항우울제로 금연에 사용되지만, 바레니클린보다 효과가 낮고 부작용이 있다. 부스피론은 불안 장애 치료제로 담배 금연에 직접 사용되지 않으며, 보티옥세틴과 브로마제팜도 금연 치료에 적합하지 않다. 따라서 **C: 바레니클린**이 최적의 치료제이다."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding while taking naproxen, a non-selective NSAID. COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib (option D) are preferred in patients with prior GI complications because they pose a lower risk of gastrointestinal toxicity compared to non-selective NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, piroxicam). Lansoprazole provides gastric protection, but switching to a COX-2 inhibitor minimizes recurrence risk. Capsaicin (A) is topical and less effective for moderate-severe osteoarthritis pain, while misoprostol (E) is a gastroprotective agent, not an analgesic. Ibuprofen (B) and piroxicam (C) remain high-risk for GI bleeding.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has open-angle glaucoma and a history of uncontrolled asthma. Beta-blocker eye drops (timolol, carteolol) are contraindicated in asthma due to risk of bronchospasm. Latanoprost, a prostaglandin analog, effectively lowers IOP in open-angle glaucoma without respiratory side effects, making it safe for asthmatic patients. Cyclosporine is used for inflammatory eye conditions, not glaucoma, and apraclonidine is typically a secondary agent. Thus, latanoprost is the appropriate first-line treatment.

**Reasoning:**  
The newborn has a heart rate of 80 beats per minute (below 100), irregular breathing, and cyanosis at 1 minute of life. According to neonatal resuscitation guidelines (e.g., NRP), when the heart rate is <100 bpm despite initial steps (positioning, suctioning, stimulation), the next step is to initiate **positive pressure ventilation (PPV)**. Continuing tactile stimulation (D) is insufficient as the heart rate remains low. Chest compressions (B) are indicated only if the heart rate drops below 60 bpm after PPV. Observation (A) is inappropriate given the instability, and epinephrine (E) is reserved for refractory bradycardia (<60 bpm) unresponsive to PPV and compressions.

**Reasoning:**  
와파린은 항응고제로 사용되며, 치료 효과를 정확히 유지하기 위해 정기적인 혈액응고 검사(인르 값 측정)가 필수적이다. 용량은 평생 일정하지 않으며(기선택 A), 비타민 D와의 직접적 연관성은 없다(기선택 B). 임신 중에는 와파린이 태아에 위험하므로 사용 불가(기선택 D), 소변색 변화는 와파린의 효과 지표가 아니다(기선택 E). 따라서 정기적인 혈액응고 검사가 가장 중요한 설명 포인트이다."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with postpartum amenorrhea following severe hemorrhage, failure to lactate, and lab findings of **low FSH (1.2 mIU/mL)**, **low LH (0.3 mIU/mL)**, and **low estradiol (5.0 pg/mL)**, while prolactin and TSH are within normal limits. This pattern indicates **pituitary hypofunction** (뇌하수체저하증), specifically consistent with **Sheehan’s syndrome**—a pituitary necrosis due to postpartum hemorrhage causing failure of gonadotropin secretion. Hypothalamic amenorrhea (B) would typically involve normal or elevated prolactin if stress-related, and premature ovarian failure (A) shows *high* FSH/LH. PCOS (D) features elevated androgens and irregular menses, and Asherman’s syndrome (E) involves uterine adhesions with normal gonadotropins. The history and hormonal profile align with pituitary injury (C)."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with abdominal distension, ascites (shifting dullness), lower limb edema, low serum albumin, prolonged prothrombin time, and thrombocytopenia. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a high serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG = 2.5 – 1.2 = 1.3 g/dL, >1.1), indicating portal hypertension. These findings are classic for **liver cirrhosis** (option A), which causes coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, ascites via portal hypertension, and splenomegaly-related thrombocytopenia. Other options are less consistent: nephrotic syndrome (B) does not cause ascites; heart failure (C) typically shows jugular venous distension and different lab patterns; peritoneal carcinomatosis (D) usually has low SAAG and malignant cells; tuberculous peritonitis (E) often has exudative ascites with high lymphocytes and low SAAG."

His language comprehension and expression are age-appropriate, ruling out **어어장애** (A). There is no evidence of selective silence in specific settings (**선택적함구증**, C), academic skill deficits (**특정학습장애**, D), or core autism features like restricted interests or social impairment (**자폐스펙트럼장애**, E).

The question asks about responsibilities under the 「보건의료기본법」 (Basic Healthcare Act) regarding climate change impacts on public health. The Act mandates the **보건복지부장관** (Minister of Health and Welfare) to conduct periodic assessments (every 5 years) on environmental and climatic factors affecting national health and to publicize the results. While the Environment Minister (C) handles climate policy broadly, the **health-specific impact assessment** under this healthcare law falls to the Health and Welfare Ministry. The President (A), Meteorological Administration (B), and Disease Control Agency (D) are not designated for this specific legal duty. Thus, **E** is correct."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient is receiving heparin for renal hemodialysis, an anticoagulant that primarily affects the intrinsic coagulation pathway. To assess potential bleeding risk before dental treatment (which may involve procedures like extraction), the **activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)** is the standard test to monitor heparin's anticoagulant effect. While platelet count (A) assesses thrombocytopenia, PT (C) monitors warfarin therapy, TT (B) is less specific for heparin, and PFA-100 (D) evaluates platelet function—none are primary for heparin monitoring. aPTT directly reflects heparin's impact on coagulation and is essential to ensure safe procedure execution.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with ammonia-smelling breath (indicative of uremia), pale mucosa (suggesting anemia), reduced saliva (common in chronic kidney disease due to fluid imbalance), and specific jaw X-ray findings: alveolar bone loss, ground-glass appearance, and radiolucent lesions. These bone changes are characteristic of **renal osteodystrophy**, a complication of **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**. CKD leads to impaired erythropoietin production (causing anemia), uremic toxins (ammonia), and disturbances in calcium/phosphate regulation, resulting in bone abnormalities visible on imaging. Other options do not fully explain the combination of oral findings and jaw X-ray results:  
- **A (Diabetes)** may cause dry mouth but not ammonia breath or ground-glass jaw lesions.  
- **B (Acute leukemia)** can cause pale mucosa but lacks the specific bone changes described.  
- **D (Iron deficiency anemia)** explains pallor but not ammonia or jaw X-ray findings.  
- **E (Alcoholic liver disease)** may cause bad breath but not the characteristic jaw bone pathology.  

Thus, **C (chronic kidney disease)** is the best fit."

Reporting non-compliance may override the patient’s autonomy for perceived benefit, creating ethical tension. Other options pair principles not directly relevant to this scenario (e.g., justice or privacy vs. non-maleficence). Thus, **C** is correct."

The patient experienced a traumatic event (witnessing a suicide) 5 days prior and now exhibits symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep disturbances, and negative mood—all criteria for **Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)**. ASD is diagnosed when symptoms occur within **3 days to 1 month** of the trauma and last for **at least 3 days but less than 1 month**. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) requires symptoms to persist **beyond 1 month**, which does not apply here (only 5 days have passed). Adjustment disorder (A) is less severe and lacks the specific trauma-related symptoms described. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (B) and Persistent Depressive Disorder (C) do not align with the acute trauma-triggered presentation.

**Reasoning:**  
회전근개복구술 후 간호중재의 주요 목적은 수술 부위를 보호하고 치유를 촉진하는 것입니다. 환측 어깨를 어깨 고정기로 외전시키는 것은 수술된 회전근개를 긴장에서 보호하고 안정적으로 유지하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 반면, 환측 팔을 움직이지 않도록 하는 것(A)은 과도한 고정으로 관절운동 제한을 유발할 수 있고, 무거운 물건을 들게 하는 것(B), 내회전 운동(C), 어깨 높이 이상으로 올리게 하는 것(E)은 수술 부위에 부담을 주어 재손상 위험을 초래할 수 있습니다. 따라서 어깨 고정기로 외전시키는 것이 가장 적절한 간호중재입니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with severe hypertension (180/110 mmHg) at 32 weeks gestation without signs of preeclampsia (no proteinuria, normal renal function, reactive non-stress test). ACE inhibitors (enalapril) are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal risks. Diuretics (furosemide) are not first-line and may reduce uteroplacental flow. Aspirin is for prevention, not acute management. Nifedipine is a recommended treatment for severe hypertension in pregnancy to rapidly lower BP safely. Observation is inappropriate given the severity of hypertension.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient exhibits signs of acute hypoxia (SpO₂ 90%, tachypnea, dyspnea) and possible decompensated heart failure. The priority nursing intervention follows the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) approach. Oxygen administration (A) directly addresses impaired oxygenation and is critical before other interventions. Administering fluids (B) could worsen volume overload in mitral regurgitation, pain medication (C) is unnecessary without pain reports, semi-Fowler’s position (D) is supportive but secondary to oxygenation, and NG tube insertion (E) is unrelated to the current presentation. Oxygen therapy is the most urgent action to stabilize the patient."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with major depressive disorder and **psychotic features** (auditory hallucinations of her deceased husband). Current treatment with desvenlafaxine (an SNRI) is insufficient. For treatment-resistant depression with psychotic symptoms, **augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic** like aripiprazole is standard. Aripiprazole is FDA-approved for this indication. Other options (gabapentin, modafinil, topiramate, methylphenidate) do not address psychotic symptoms or are not indicated for depression augmentation.

타목시펜은 에스트로겐 수용체(ER)를 표적으로 하며, 에스트로겐 수용체는 전사 인자 역할을 합니다. 에스트로겐이 결합하면 특정 유전자의 전사를 촉진합니다. 타목시펜은 이 에스트로겐 수용체의 활성을 억제하여 유전자 전사 촉진을 방해합니다. 따라서 표적 단백질인 에스트로겐 수용체가 직접 매개하는 생화학 반응은 유전자의 전사 촉진입니다. 다른 선택지는 타목시펜의 주요 작용 메커니즘과 직접 관련이 없습니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The question describes increased EGFR activity in cancer cells, which drives uncontrolled growth. Targeting EGFR directly is a established personalized therapy. Option C proposes using a monoclonal antibody to inhibit EGFR activity (e.g., cetuximab), which blocks ligand binding and receptor signaling, aligning with clinical practice for EGFR-overexpressing cancers. Option A would exacerbate EGFR signaling, B and D target unrelated pathways (apoptosis and Ras), and E would enhance kinase activity, potentially worsening the condition. Thus, C is the appropriate targeted therapy."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with jaundice and markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (983 U/L) and GGT (1,751 U/L), indicating cholestatic liver disease. The positive antismitochondrial antibody (항사립체항체 +) is highly specific for **primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**, which predominantly affects middle-aged women. Viral hepatitis markers are negative, and autoimmune hepatitis is unlikely due to negative antinuclear antibody and the cholestatic enzyme pattern. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis typically shows hepatocellular injury (elevated ALT/AST) without such extreme ALP/GGT elevation, and primary sclerosing cholangitis is more common in men with ulcerative colitis and usually AMA-negative.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient exhibits acute stress reaction/post-traumatic symptoms with situational anxiety triggered by sharp noises. Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) provides rapid relief but causes sedation and risks dependence. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used as a non-sedating alternative for situational anxiety (e.g., noise triggers) by mitigating physical symptoms like tachycardia and hyperventilation without the drowsiness associated with benzodiazepines. Other options (doxepin, trazodone, nortriptyline, methylphenidate) are not primary alternatives for acute situational anxiety management in this context.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with elevated clinic blood pressure (155/88 mmHg) but well-controlled home readings (e.g., morning 137/84 mmHg). This discrepancy suggests possible **white-coat hypertension**. The gold standard to confirm this and differentiate from sustained hypertension is **24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**, which provides continuous, real-world blood pressure data over a full day. Holter monitoring (A) assesses arrhythmias, echocardiography (B) evaluates cardiac structure, thyroid ultrasound (C) is unrelated, and coronary CT (E) investigates coronary artery disease—none address the blood pressure discrepancy directly.

융모막암종(choriocarcinoma)은 태반의 융모상피세포에서 발생하며, 이 세포는 대량의 β-hCG(사람융모생식샘자극호르몬)를 분비합니다. 항암화학요법 후 추후관리에서 경과를 관찰하기 위해 가장 중요한 호르몬 검사는 β-hCG 수치입니다. β-hCG 수치가 정상화되고 유지되면 치료 성공을 나타내고, 재발 시 증가합니다. 다른 호르몬(옥시토신, 안드로겐, hPL, TSH)은 이 질환의 모니터링에 직접적으로 관련이 없습니다. 따라서 정답은 E입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with **Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**—characterized by uncomfortable leg sensations worse at rest/night, relieved by movement—and **major depressive disorder**. SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine) can **worsen RLS** and are unsuitable. Amitriptyline (a tricyclic) may exacerbate RLS and cause sedation. **Bupropion** (C), a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, treats depression **without worsening RLS** and may even improve RLS symptoms due to dopaminergic effects. Benlapсин (A) is an antipsychotic, inappropriate here. Thus, bupropion is the optimal choice."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient presents with prolonged fever, weight loss, anemia, and markedly elevated ESR (90 mm/hr) and CRP (22 mg/L), suggesting systemic inflammation. Infections (blood/urine cultures, TB test) and autoimmune causes (ANA, RF) are negative, and imaging (chest X-ray, abdominal CT) is normal. The combination of anemia, high ESR, and unexplained fever warrants evaluation for hematologic malignancy (e.g., multiple myeloma or lymphoma). Bone marrow aspiration biopsy (option C) is the appropriate next step to assess for marrow infiltration or clonal disorders. Other options (lumbar puncture, exploratory surgery, endoscopy with echo, PET-CT) are less indicated without specific neurological, abdominal, or cardiac symptoms.

**Reasoning:**  
임신 9주 시 심한 오심과 구토로 인해 음식 섭취가 불가능하고 체중이 감소한 경우, 주요 우선 사정 항목은 **케톤뇨**입니다. 지속적인 구토로 인한 영양 부족과 수분 손실로 인해 체내에서 지방 대사가 활발해지며 케톤체가 생성되어 소변에 나타납니다. 이는 저혈당증, 탈수, 전해질 불균형 등 심각한 합병증으로 이어질 수 있으므로 즉시 확인이 필요합니다. 고혈당, 고혈압, 고칼륨혈증 등은 이 증상에서 직접적인 우선 사정 항목이 아니며, 배뇨통은 관련이 적습니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The symptoms described—sudden dizziness, head ""ting,"" and tingling/numbness in extremities—indicate **hyperventilation** due to pain during labor. Hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis, leading to cerebral vasoconstriction and these neurological symptoms. The correct intervention is **rebreathing into a paper bag (E)** to increase CO₂ levels and correct alkalosis. Options A, B, C, and D address labor progression or emergencies unrelated to hyperventilation and could worsen symptoms.

**Reasoning:**  
After a cesarean delivery, the **most urgent priority** is to assess for **postpartum hemorrhage**, which is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Vaginal bleeding (option B) directly indicates uterine contraction status and potential complications like retained placental tissue or atony. While other options (bowel movement, breast engorgement, nutrition, genital burns) are important for overall recovery, they are **not immediately life-threatening** compared to uncontrolled bleeding. Immediate assessment of bleeding ensures timely intervention to prevent shock or severe blood loss.

**Reasoning:**  
성요한풀은 CYP3A4 대사효소의 유도제로, 심바스타틴의 대사를 촉진하여 혈장 농도를 낮춥니다. 성요한풀 복용을 중단하면 대사효소 유도가 감소하여 심바스타틴의 대사가 느려지고 혈장 농도가 상승합니다. 이로 인해 심바스타틴으로 인한 횡문근융해증 발병 가능성이 높아집니다. 따라서 정답은 대사효소유도 감소입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
The patient has advanced liver cirrhosis with ascites and is on diuretics, presenting with acute oliguria and rising BUN/creatinine. Key lab findings include **low urine sodium (9 mEq/L)** and **elevated serum creatinine (2.5 mg/dL)** without urinary protein or hematuria. This pattern is classic for **hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)**, a functional renal failure in cirrhosis due to severe vasodilation and reduced renal perfusion. Other options are less likely:  
- **B (Acute glomerulonephritis)** typically shows hematuria/proteinuria.  
- **C (Amyloidosis)** is chronic and not acute.  
- **D (HUS)** would show microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (e.g., schistocytes, high LDH), which is absent.  
- **E (Acute interstitial nephritis)** often presents with drug exposure, fever, and urinary eosinophils/WBCs, which are not present."

The patient presents with left leg pain, severe swelling, and a positive Homans sign post-cesarean section, indicating suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Massage (C) is contraindicated as it risks dislodging clots. Pressure (D) may worsen venous congestion. Semi-Fowler’s position (A) aids general comfort but not specific DVT management. Elevating the affected leg (B) reduces swelling and promotes venous return, which is the correct initial nursing intervention. Placing a pillow under the knee (E) does not adequately elevate the entire leg.

**Reasoning:**  
양성전립샘과다형성(BPH)에서 전립샘이 비대해 요관을 압박하여 폐쇄를 유발할 수 있습니다. 이 과정에서 **5α-환원효소**는 테스토스테론을 디히드로테스토스테론(DHT)으로 전환하며, DHT는 전립샘 성장 촉진에 주요 역할을 합니다. BPH에서 이 효소의 작용이 증가하면 전립샘 비대를 악화시켜 요관 폐쇄 위험을 높입니다. 다른 선택지는 BPH의 주요 병리와 일치하지 않습니다: A는 요흐름 감소를 유발하므로 오답, B는 PSA가 일반적으로 증가함, D는 외요도괄약근 기능이 BPH에서 주요 원인 아님, E는 안드로겐 감소가 전립샘 작용을 감소시킴. 따라서 **C**가 정답입니다."

The patient has chronic alcohol dependence with recent abstinence and strong cravings. Key blood tests show severe renal impairment (creatinine 4.0 mg/dL, creatinine clearance 18 mL/min). Acamprosate (E) is contraindicated in renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) due to risk of accumulation. Naltrexone (B) is effective for reducing alcohol cravings and can be used with dose adjustment in renal impairment. Thiamine (A) addresses deficiency prevention but does not treat cravings. Valproate (C) carries hepatotoxicity risk and is not first-line for alcohol dependence. Paliperidone (D) is an antipsychotic with no role in alcohol cessation.

**Reasoning:**  
The nursing diagnosis ""비효과적 말초조직 관류의 위험"" (Risk for ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion) in a postoperative hip replacement patient on strict bed rest primarily addresses the risk of poor venous return and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Anti-embolism stockings (항혈전스타킹) are a standard intervention to promote venous circulation and prevent DVT by applying graduated compression. Restricting lower limb movement (A) would worsen perfusion, elevating the knee with a pillow (B) may compromise surgical positioning, frequent dressing changes (D) address wound care not perfusion, and prophylactic antibiotics (E) target infection, not perfusion issues. Thus, applying anti-embolism stockings is the most appropriate intervention.

**Reasoning:**  
호스피스 병동에서 말기암 환자의 불안과 우울감을 다루는 간호중재는 환자의 정서적 지지를 중심으로 해야 합니다. 수면제 투여(A)는 부적절한 약물 사용으로 증상을 억제할 수 있으나 근본적인 정서적 지지를 제공하지 않습니다. 회복을 약속하는 말(B)이나 시간 지나면 기분이 좋아질 것이라는 말(E)은 현실적이지 않으며 환자의 감정을 무시합니다. 감정 표현을 자제하라고 조언하는(D)도 환자의 정서적 표현을 억제하여 부적절합니다. 반면 환자 옆에 있어 손을 잡는(C)는 현장에서 정서적 지지와 위안을 제공하며, 호스피스 간호의 핵심 원칙인 인간적 접촉과 수용을 반영합니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient exhibits signs of hypovolemic shock: hypotension (BP 80/50 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse 130 bpm), pallor, low urine output (20 mL/hour), and abdominal distension suggesting possible internal bleeding. The priority intervention is to restore intravascular volume and perfusion, which requires immediate intravenous fluid administration. Other options address less urgent issues (e.g., positioning, bladder irrigation, pain control, or dumping syndrome) that are secondary to stabilizing hemodynamics.

**Reasoning:**  
전체대장절제술 후 영구적 회장루가 있는 환자의 피부손상 예방을 위해 가장 중요한 간호중재는 장루 주위 피부를 보호하는 것입니다. 장루 배출물은 산성이며 피부를 자극할 수 있으므로, 주머니 부착 전 피부보호제를 적용하여 장루 배출물이 피부에 직접 닿지 않도록 하는 것이 핵심입니다. 옵션 E는 이 원칙에 부합합니다. 다른 옵션은 부적절한 간호행동(예: 과도한 소독제 사용, 불필요한 식품 권장 등)이나 부적절한 주머니 교환 주기로 피부 손상을 유발할 수 있습니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The serum potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L indicates hyperkalemia. Among the listed diuretics, **스피로놀락톤 (spironolactone)** is a potassium-sparing diuretic that inhibits aldosterone, reducing renal potassium excretion and predisposing to hyperkalemia. In contrast, 만니톨 (mannitol), 메톨라존 (metolazone), 토르세미드 (torsemide), and 하이드로클로로티아지드 (hydrochlorothiazide) are non-potassium-sparing diuretics that typically cause hypokalemia by increasing potassium loss. Thus, spironolactone is the most likely culprit.

**Reasoning:**  
조혈세포이식 후 2주인 아동은 면역계가 약화되어 감염 위험도가 높습니다. 신선한 과일(기생충, 박테리아 위험)과 채소(세척에도 감염 위험)는 피해야 하며, 살짝 구운 고기도 불완전히 조리되어 감염 위험이 있습니다. 말린 과일은 곰팡이 또는 박테리아가 존재할 수 있습니다. 밀봉된 통조림은 열처리로 안전하며, 감염 위험을 최소화하는 가장 적절한 선택입니다.

**Reasoning:**  
In end-of-life pediatric care, the priority is emotional support and presence for families. Option C allows the mother to stay with the child, which is essential for closure and comfort. Option A is inappropriate as rushing tasks causes stress. Option B gives false hope, which is unethical when death is imminent. Option D may not always be accurate and can create false assurances. Option E suppresses natural grief, which is harmful; parents should express emotions to support the child. Thus, C is the correct intervention."

**Reasoning:**  
The evaluation measures the **implementation** of the program (frequency of education sessions, clinic operations, and counseling participation), which aligns with **process evaluation** (과정평가).

Input evaluation (B) focuses on resources, impact evaluation (C) on changes, structure evaluation (D) on organizational setup, and outcome evaluation (E) on final results—none match the described metrics.

The question asks about the scope of medical practices for dedicated health care officers under the ""Special Measures Law for Health and Medical Care in Rural and Fishing Villages."" Public health officers in such contexts typically perform basic diagnostic examinations to assess disease status and refer patients, rather than treating complex conditions, delivering babies, administering specialized medications, or managing acute patient recovery. Option D (""질병상태를 판별하기 위한 진찰"") aligns with this role, as it involves examining to determine disease status—a core preventive and diagnostic function. Options A, B, C, and E involve advanced medical interventions beyond the typical scope of such officers.

**Reasoning:**  
The question asks which infectious disease undergoes mass screening targeting high school students for early detection. Tuberculosis (결핵) is historically and commonly screened in school settings due to its contagious nature in close-contact environments and public health initiatives. While other diseases like influenza or typhoid may have surveillance, systematic mass screening of high school students is most characteristic of tuberculosis control programs in many countries, including South Korea. Chickenpox and Japanese encephalitis are typically managed through vaccination or outbreak response rather than routine mass testing, and influenza screening is not standard for all students.  

**Answer Selection:**  
A is correct because tuberculosis screening in schools is a well-established public health practice for early case detection."

레보도파는 파킨슨병 치료에 사용되는 약으로, 환자가 서서히 자세를 변경하도록 유도하는 중재가 중요합니다. 이는 레보도파 사용 시 발생할 수 있는 정체성 저혈압(정체성 저혈압)을 예방하기 위함입니다. 수분 제한(А), 식후 30분 투여(В), 사우나 권장(С), 변비 시 복용 중단(Ｄ)은 레보도파 투여와 관련이 없습니다. 따라서 정상적인 간호 중재는 자세 변경을 서서히 하도록 하는 것입니다.

**Reasoning:**  
The scenario describes mutant bacteria lacking thymidine kinase gene function being exposed to DNA from normal bacteria, resulting in functional gene recovery. This matches **transformation**, where bacteria incorporate foreign DNA directly from the environment. Conjugation requires direct cell-to-cell contact (not mentioned), transduction involves viral vectors (not indicated), transposition refers to mobile genetic elements moving within a genome, and posttranslational modification alters existing proteins rather than introducing new genes.

For patients who underwent chronic sinusitis surgery, coughing with an open mouth helps prevent increased intracranial pressure and protects the surgical site. Using a straw (D) can create negative pressure and disrupt healing. Lying with the operated side down (E) may cause fluid accumulation. Changing position hourly (A) is general care, not specific to sinus surgery. Standing on the operated side (B) is unsafe. Thus, C is the correct intervention.

아스피린은 비정상적인 천식 발작을 유발할 수 있는 아스피린 유발 호흡기 질환(AERD)이 있는 환자에게 금기입니다. 이 경우 이산화질소 수용체 억제제인 클로피도그렐(clopidogrel)은 아스피린 대체로 사용되며, 허혈성 뇌졸중 재발 예방에 적합합니다. 와파린, 에녹사파린, 리바록사반은 항응고제로 주로 대동맥 혈전 또는 심방 세동으로 인한 뇌졸중 예방에 사용되며, 이산화질소 수용체 억제제가 선호됩니다. 프라수그렐은 심근경색 치료에 주로 사용되며, 뇌졸중 환자에게는 권장되지 않습니다. 따라서 클로피도그렐이 적절한 대체 약물입니다."

아스피린은 혈소판 기능 억제제로서 위장관 출혈 위험을 증가시킬 수 있습니다. 오메가3산에틸에스테르(고도 오메가3)는 혈소판 집합을 억제하는 작용을 하여 아스피린과 병용 시 출혈 위험을 추가로 높입니다. 리나글립틴, 메트포르민, 이르베사르탄, 피타바스타틴은 아스피린과의 병용에서 значитель한 출혈 위험을 증가시키는 것으로 알려져 있지 않습니다. 따라서 정답은 오메가3산에틸에스테르입니다."

자궁내막증(자궁내막과형)은 에스트로겐과 프로게스테론의 불균형으로 인해 자궁내막이 두꺼워지는 질환입니다. 치료하지 않을 경우, 자궁내막이 비정상적으로 두꺼워져 임신 시 배아가 자궁내막에 정착하는 데 방해할 수 있으므로 **난임이 초래될 수 있습니다**(선택지 A). 다른 선택지는 잘못되었습니다: B는 월경량이 감소한다는 주장이 부정적이며, 자궁내막증은 일반적으로 월경량을 증가시킵니다. C는 32세 여성에게 폐경증상이 나타날 것이라는 말은 생리적으로 불가능합니다. D와 E는 자궁내막증이 질(바깥 생식기)과 직접적으로 관련이 없으므로 부적절합니다. 따라서 정답은 A입니다."

후기감퇴(late deceleration)는 수축 후 태아 심박수 감소가 나타나며, 태반관류 부족으로 인한 태아 산소 공급 장애를 의미합니다. 이는 태아의 저산소화 위험을 나타내는 비안정 징후로, 태반 기능 저하와 관련이 있습니다. 제대 압박은 변동감퇴(variable deceleration)를 유발하고, 태아 건강 상태나 분만 임박은 후기감퇴와 직접 연결되지 않습니다. 태아 아두 압박은 조기감퇴(early deceleration)를 유발합니다. 따라서 정답은 태반관류 저하 상태입니다."

**Reasoning:**  
For spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients, guidelines recommend third-generation cephalosporins like cefotaxime as first-line empirical therapy due to their efficacy against common pathogens (e.g., *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*) and ascitic fluid penetration. The patient’s ascitic fluid PMN count (≥250/mm³) confirms SBP. Although norfloxacin prophylaxis was used, cefotaxime remains standard empirical therapy, especially given potential fluoroquinolone resistance. Ampicillin lacks reliable gram-negative coverage, vancomycin is reserved for resistant organisms, ciprofloxacin may be compromised by prior prophylaxis, and azithromycin is not recommended.

**Reasoning:**  
The patient is a primipara with cervical dilation stagnant at 5–6 cm over 5 hours and uterine contraction intervals prolonged to >10 minutes. Normal active labor requires contractions every 3–5 minutes with progressive dilation. The infrequent contractions (interval >10 min) and minimal cervical change indicate inadequate uterine activity, characteristic of **저긴장성 자궁기능부전 (hypotonic uterine dysfunction)**. Option E (hypertonic) involves excessively frequent/strong contractions, which is not present. Options A, B, and C describe normal or rapid progression, which contradicts the delayed course."

**Reasoning:**  
For preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing iodinated contrast imaging (like iohexol), **intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids** is the cornerstone of prophylaxis. **0.9% normal saline (생리식염수)** is the recommended isotonic fluid, as it maintains intravascular volume and reduces renal vasoconstriction caused by contrast media. Albumin (A) is not standard for this purpose, dextrose (B) is hypotonic and inappropriate, mannitol (C) is an osmotic diuretic that may worsen renal perfusion, and low-dose dopamine (E) has been disproven for renal protection and is potentially harmful. Thus, **D** is the correct choice."

The scenario describes a soft, boggy uterus that bleeds massively when massaged 1 hour postpartum in a diabetic mother who delivered a macrosomic baby. This presentation is classic for **uterine atony**, where the uterus fails to contract effectively after delivery, leading to uncontrolled hemorrhage. Uterine rupture (B) would involve severe pain and tearing signs, cervical hematoma (A) localized bleeding from the cervix, uterine inversion (D) involves protrusion of uterine tissue through the cervix, and endometritis (E) presents with infection signs like fever and foul discharge later. The immediate mass bleeding from a non-tonic uterus points to atony."

E  

**Reasoning:**  
- **Option A** is incorrect because hydrophilic (not hydrophobic) surfaces promote better bone adhesion.  
- **Option B** is false; rougher surfaces (e.g., SLA) enhance osseointegration, not smooth ones.  
- **Option C** is wrong; titanium’s passive oxide film (TiO₂) is highly biocompatible.  
- **Option D** misrepresents RBM: it uses resorbable particles (not acid treatment with H₂SO₄/HCl).  
- **Option E** accurately describes SLA: it involves sandblasting with alumina particles followed by acid etching.
