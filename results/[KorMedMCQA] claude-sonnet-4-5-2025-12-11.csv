Given data:
- Vaccinated group: 20 hospitalizations out of 4,000 people
- Unvaccinated group: 40 hospitalizations out of 2,000 people

First, I'll calculate the incidence rates:
- Vaccinated: 20/4,000 = 0.005 (or 0.5%)
- Unvaccinated: 40/2,000 = 0.020 (or 2.0%)

Vaccine effectiveness formula:
VE = (1 - Risk Ratio) × 100%
VE = (1 - [Rate in vaccinated / Rate in unvaccinated]) × 100%

Calculating:
VE = (1 - [0.005 / 0.020]) × 100%
VE = (1 - 0.25) × 100%
VE = 0.75 × 100%
VE = 75%

The reorder point formula is:
ROP = (Daily demand × Lead time) + Safety stock

Step 1: Calculate daily demand
Daily demand = 7,300 ÷ 365 = 20 bottles/day

Step 2: Calculate demand during lead time
Demand during lead time = 20 × 5 = 100 bottles

Step 3: Calculate reorder point
ROP = 100 + 146 = 246 bottles

Given:
- ΔTf = 0.52°C
- L_iso = 3.4
- Kf for water = 1.86 °C·kg/mol
- Assume molarity ≈ molality

The freezing point depression formula is:
ΔTf = i × Kf × m

Where i is the van't Hoff factor. For an electrolyte like cocaine hydrochloride (which dissociates into 2 ions), the relationship between i and L_iso is:
i = 1 + α(n-1), where n = 2 for this salt

From L_iso = 3.4:
L_iso = i × M (where M is molecular weight)
This gives us: i = L_iso/M = 3.4/M

However, using the standard approach:
0.52 = i × 1.86 × m

If i ≈ 1.7 (typical for a weak electrolyte):
m = 0.52/(1.7 × 1.86) ≈ 0.164

Checking the options:
- 1/100 = 0.01
- 1/20 = 0.05
- 11/168 ≈ 0.0655
- 13/85 ≈ 0.153
- 34/99 ≈ 0.343

Given information:
- Procaine HCl: 1.0g, MW = 273, L_iso = 3.4
- NaCl: MW = 58, L_iso = 3.4

The L_iso value relates to the Liso method in pharmacy, where:
- Mass of NaCl equivalent = (Mass of drug × MW_NaCl × L_iso_drug) / (MW_drug × L_iso_NaCl)

Since both compounds have the same L_iso value (3.4), this simplifies to:
Mass of NaCl = (1.0 × 58) / 273
Mass of NaCl = 58/273
Mass of NaCl ≈ 0.212g

- CMC_B = 3.0×10^-5 mol/L
- Molar ratio A:B = 2:3
- Ideal mixed micelle formation

For ideal mixed micelles, I use the equation:

1/CMC_mix = α_A/CMC_A + α_B/CMC_B

where α_A and α_B are the mole fractions.

From the 2:3 ratio:
- α_A = 2/(2+3) = 2/5 = 0.4
- α_B = 3/(2+3) = 3/5 = 0.6

Calculating:
1/CMC_mix = 0.4/(8.0×10^-5) + 0.6/(3.0×10^-5)
1/CMC_mix = 5000 + 20000
1/CMC_mix = 25000

**Stoichiometry:**
- S₂O₃²⁻ needed for 0.060 mol Ag⁺: 0.060 × 2 = 0.12 mol
- S₂O₃²⁻ remaining: 0.32 - 0.12 = 0.20 mol
- [Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻ formed: 0.060 mol

**At equilibrium:**
- [[Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻] ≈ 0.060 M
- [S₂O₃²⁻] ≈ 0.20 M

**Formation constant:**
K_f = [[Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻] / ([Ag⁺][S₂O₃²⁻]²) = 1.0×10²¹

**Solving for [Ag⁺]:**
[Ag⁺] = [[Ag(S₂O₃)₂]³⁻] / (K_f × [S₂O₃²⁻]²)

[Ag⁺] = 0.060 / (1.0×10²¹ × (0.20)²)

[Ag⁺] = 0.060 / (1.0×10²¹ × 0.04)

Using the osmotic pressure equation:
π = (n/V)RT = (m/MV)RT

Where m is mass and M is molar mass.

Substituting:
0.5 = (a/(M × 1))RT

Solving for M:
0.5M = aRT
M = aRT/0.5

- K = C_oil/C_water = 10
- Total drug A = 55 mg
- Water volume = 50 mL
- Chloroform volume = 50 mL

Let x = amount in chloroform layer (mg)
Then (55-x) = amount in water layer (mg)

Since volumes are equal (50 mL each):
- C_oil = x/50
- C_water = (55-x)/50

Using the partition coefficient:
K = C_oil/C_water = 10

(x/50)/((55-x)/50) = 10

x/(55-x) = 10

x = 10(55-x)

x = 550 - 10x

11x = 550

Given:
- Initial: 0.04 mol/L NH₄OH solution
- Equal volumes mixed
- Final [OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻⁵ mol/L
- Kb = 1.0×10⁻⁵

After mixing equal volumes:
- [NH₄OH] after dilution = 0.04/2 = 0.02 mol/L
- [NH₄⁺] from (NH₄)₂SO₄ = C (where C is what we're finding)

Using the equilibrium expression:
NH₄OH ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻

Kb = [NH₄⁺][OH⁻]/[NH₄OH] = 1.0×10⁻⁵

At equilibrium:
- [OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻⁵
- [NH₄OH] ≈ 0.02 - 1.0×10⁻⁵ ≈ 0.02
- [NH₄⁺] = C + 1.0×10⁻⁵

Substituting:
1.0×10⁻⁵ = (C + 1.0×10⁻⁵)(1.0×10⁻⁵)/0.02

1.0×10⁻⁵ × 0.02 = (C + 1.0×10⁻⁵)(1.0×10⁻⁵)

2.0×10⁻⁷ = (C + 1.0×10⁻⁵)(1.0×10⁻⁵)

C + 1.0×10⁻⁵ = 0.02

C = 0.02 - 1.0×10⁻⁵ ≈ 0.02

This is the concentration after mixing. The original (NH₄)₂SO₄ solution concentration was 2C = 0.04 mol/L.

pharm_112,pharm,0,D,D,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the minimum [NH4Cl] to prevent Mg(OH)₂ precipitation.

Given:
- [Mg²⁺] = 1.0×10⁻³ mol/L
- [NH₄OH] = 0.1 mol/L
- Ksp of Mg(OH)₂ = 1.0×10⁻¹³
- Kb of NH₄OH = 1.0×10⁻⁵

For no precipitation: [Mg²⁺][OH⁻]² < Ksp

Maximum [OH⁻] before precipitation:
[OH⁻]² < 1.0×10⁻¹³ / 1.0×10⁻³ = 1.0×10⁻¹⁰
[OH⁻] < 1.0×10⁻⁵ mol/L

For NH₄OH equilibrium:
NH₄OH ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻
Kb = [NH₄⁺][OH⁻]/[NH₄OH] = 1.0×10⁻⁵

With NH₄Cl added, [NH₄⁺] ≈ [NH₄Cl] (common ion effect suppresses dissociation)

To keep [OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻⁵:
1.0×10⁻⁵ = [NH₄⁺](1.0×10⁻⁵)/0.1
[NH₄⁺] = 0.1 mol/L

Therefore, minimum [NH₄Cl] = 0.1 mol/L

Given:
- Initial microorganisms: N₀ = 10⁸
- Temperature: 121°C for 15 minutes
- D-value = 1 minute

The D-value represents the time needed to reduce the microbial population by one log cycle (90% reduction or factor of 10).

Using the formula:
log(N/N₀) = -t/D

Where:
- t = 15 minutes
- D = 1 minute

log(N/N₀) = -15/1 = -15

Therefore:
N/N₀ = 10⁻¹⁵

N = N₀ × 10⁻¹⁵ = 10⁸ × 10⁻¹⁵ = 10⁻⁷

The probability of non-sterility (비무균확률) is N = 10⁻⁷

- Purchases (구매비용) = 200 million won  
- Ending Inventory (연말재고) = 50 million won
- Beginning Inventory (기초재고) = ?

Solving for Beginning Inventory:
220 = Beginning Inventory + 200 - 50
220 = Beginning Inventory + 150

dentist_727,dentist,0,A,A,"Looking at this problem, I need to calculate the amount of epinephrine in one cartridge of local anesthetic.

Given information:
- 2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine
- 1 cartridge used

Standard dental cartridge volume = 1.8 mL

Calculation:
- 1:100,000 epinephrine means 1 g in 100,000 mL
- This equals 0.01 mg/mL (or 10 μg/mL)

For 1.8 mL cartridge:
- 0.01 mg/mL × 1.8 mL = 0.018 mg

pharm_401,pharm,0,D,D,"Looking at this two-phase system problem, I need to find the mass of the upper layer.

Given:
- Total: 71.0 g water + 29.0 g phenol = 100.0 g total
- Water layer: 10.0 w/w% phenol (90.0% water)
- Phenol layer: 33.0 w/w% water (67.0% phenol)
- Phenol density at 40°C: 1.07 g/cm³

Let me denote:
- W = mass of water layer
- P = mass of phenol layer

Mass balance equations:
1) W + P = 100.0 g
2) 0.10W + 0.67P = 29.0 g (phenol balance)

From equation 2:
0.10W + 0.67P = 29.0
0.10W = 29.0 - 0.67P
W = 290 - 6.7P

Substituting into equation 1:
290 - 6.7P + P = 100
290 - 5.7P = 100
5.7P = 190
P = 33.33 g

Therefore: W = 100 - 33.33 = 66.67 g

Since phenol (density 1.07 g/cm³) is denser than water (density ~1.0 g/cm³), the phenol-rich layer is the bottom layer and the water-rich layer is the upper layer.

The upper layer mass = 66.7 g

pharm_406,pharm,0,C,C,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the osmotic pressure using the freezing point depression data.

Given:
- Freezing point depression: ΔTf = 0.34°C
- Temperature: T = 20°C = 293K
- i value (van't Hoff factor): 3.4
- Gas constant: R

From freezing point depression:
ΔTf = i × Kf × m

Where Kf for water = 1.86 K·kg/mol

Solving for molality:
0.34 = 3.4 × 1.86 × m
m = 0.34/(3.4 × 1.86) = 0.0538 mol/kg

For dilute aqueous solutions, molality ≈ molarity, so:
c ≈ 0.0538 mol/L

Osmotic pressure:
π = i × c × R × T
π = 3.4 × 0.0538 × R × 293
π = 3.4 × 0.0538 × 293 × R
π ≈ 53.6R

However, checking if there's a simpler relationship:
If we use ΔTf/Kf directly:
c = ΔTf/(i × Kf) = 0.34/(3.4 × 1.86) ≈ 0.0538

Then: π = 0.0538 × 3.4 × 293 × R ≈ 53.6R

But looking at answer choice E: 293R
This would occur if: π = c × R × T where c = 1 mol/L

Let me reconsider: If the effective concentration is 0.34/1.86 ≈ 0.183 mol/L
Then: π = 0.183 × 293 × R ≈ 53.6R

None match exactly, but checking the ratio approach:
0.34/1.86 × 293 ≈ 53.5

The closest answer considering possible rounding or interpretation is A: 2.93R if we divide by 20, but more likely there's a factor I'm missing.

Given the answer choices and typical exam patterns, the most reasonable answer is:

pharm_409,pharm,0,E,E,"Looking at this problem, I need to find the shelf life (t90%) for a suspension of a poorly soluble drug.

Given information:
- Solubility at 25℃: 0.3 g/100 mL
- First-order degradation rate constant: k = 5.0×10^-2 month^-1
- Initial concentration: 6.0 g/100 mL

Since the initial concentration (6.0 g/100 mL) exceeds the solubility (0.3 g/100 mL), this is a suspension with both dissolved and undissolved drug.

For a suspension with excess solid, the dissolved drug concentration remains constant at the solubility limit (0.3 g/100 mL) as long as solid remains. The degradation follows first-order kinetics for the dissolved portion.

The key insight is that t90% represents when 90% of the original drug remains, meaning 10% has degraded:
- Amount degraded = 0.10 × 6.0 = 0.6 g/100 mL

For first-order kinetics with constant concentration (due to dissolution replenishment):
- Amount degraded = C_s × k × t
- 0.6 = 0.3 × 5.0×10^-2 × t
- 0.6 = 0.015 × t
- t = 0.6/0.015 = 40 months

Key relationships:
- 1 mole of EDTA reacts with 1 mole of Al³⁺
- 1 mole of Al₂O₃ contains 2 moles of Al³⁺
- Therefore, 1 mole of Al₂O₃ requires 2 moles of EDTA

Calculation:
- 1 mL of 0.05 mol/L EDTA = 0.05 mmol EDTA
- 0.05 mmol EDTA corresponds to 0.05/2 = 0.025 mmol Al₂O₃
- Mass of Al₂O₃ = 0.025 mmol × 102 mg/mmol = 2.55 mg
