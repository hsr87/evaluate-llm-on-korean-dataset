In traditional Korean culture, particularly in Korean shamanism (musok), natural elements are often believed to house spirits. Sacred sites frequently include specific natural objects like ancient trees (e.g., village guardian trees known as ""sungna mul"") and rocks or stone formations (e.g., mountain shrines). Among the choices, ""나무와 돌"" (trees and stones) aligns with this belief system, as these are commonly regarded as embodying sacred energy in Korean folklore and rituals.

The question asks about the typical operating hours of kindergartens (어린이집) in South Korea. These facilities primarily serve working parents and align with standard work schedules. In Korea, most 어린이집 operate on weekdays with extended hours to accommodate parents' commuting and work times, commonly from early morning to evening (e.g., 7:30 AM to 7:30 PM). Option B (9 AM–2 PM) is too short for full-day childcare, while weekend options (C and D) are not standard as these centers typically close on weekends. Thus, option A matches the general operating hours.

The question asks about the typical operating hours of full-day kindergartens (종일제 유치원) in South Korea. Full-day kindergartens are generally designed to accommodate working parents and operate during weekdays, not weekends, eliminating options A and B. Option C (7 AM to 8 PM) is unusually long for standard kindergarten hours and is more typical of extended childcare services. The standard schedule for full-day kindergartens in Korea is commonly from 8 AM to 4 PM on weekdays, aligning with typical work hours for parents. Thus, option D is the most accurate.

In South Korea, public (국·공립) educational institutions, such as public kindergartens and schools, receive significant government funding and subsidies. This results in lower tuition fees compared to private (사립) institutions, which rely more heavily on parental fees to cover operational and facility costs. Generally, private institutions have higher tuition across most levels of education in Korea. Therefore, the correct answer is that public institution fees are typically cheaper.

The context describes ""사람도서관"" (human library) where individuals with professional knowledge and experience (""전문적인 지식과 경험을 가진 사람"") are registered as ""사람책"" (human books). The library allows readers to ""borrow"" these individuals for lectures. The blank modifies ""사람도서관"" and should indicate the purpose or method of the library.  
- Choice A (""전문가를 활용하는"" – utilizing experts) matches because the library directly uses existing experts as resources.  
- Choice B (""전문가를 양성하는"" – training experts) is incorrect because the library registers already knowledgeable people, not training them.  
- Choices C and D mention ""기술자"" (technicians), which is narrower and less accurate than ""전문가"" (experts) used in the context.  

Thus, A is the most appropriate choice.

The context explains that simply stating calorie content (e.g., ""550 calories"") is ineffective for consumers. However, expressing it in terms of physical effort (e.g., ""need to run 9km"") makes the calorie content tangible. The blank requires a phrase meaning ""how much physical activity is needed to burn the calories."" Among the choices, **B (""얼마나 몸을 움직여야"" - how much you need to move your body)** directly matches this idea of required exercise. Other options (A: food choice, C: cautious actions, D: when to care) do not align with the example of running distance.

The context explains that tickets with deadlines become unusable after the period expires (""기한이 정해져 있는 티켓의 경우 기간이 지나면 사용하지 못하게 된다""). However, even tickets nearing expiration can be sold via the mobile market. The key point is that without this market, the tickets would lose their value once the deadline passes. The blank describes the state of the product *after* the period ends. Option A (""가치가 사라지는"") correctly matches this idea, as the tickets become worthless (value disappears) after expiration. Other options (price rising, demand increasing, production decreasing) do not align with the described scenario.

The question asks about difficulties in sending children to public or national educational institutions in Korean society. In South Korea, public childcare facilities (such as public kindergartens or daycare centers) are highly sought after due to their affordability and reliability compared to private options. A major issue is the long waiting lists after application submission, as demand far exceeds availability. While private institutions often have high tuition costs (choice C), this is less relevant for public institutions, which are subsidized. Choice B (application itself being difficult) is not the primary concern, and choice D (low education quality) is generally not associated with public institutions in Korea.

The question asks for the year South Korea completely overcame the foreign exchange crisis, referring to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. South Korea received an IMF bailout in late 1997. While initial recovery signs appeared in 1998, the economy showed strong rebound with high GDP growth (around 10.9%) in 1999, marking the crisis as largely overcome. Although IMF program formally ended around 2000 and full repayment occurred later, the year commonly recognized in historical context for *completely* overcoming the crisis is **1999년**, as it signifies sustained economic recovery and stability.

The context explains that rapid breeding causes overpopulation in limited zoo spaces, leading to increased stress in animals. Specifically, it describes how reducing lion numbers (by sending them to other zoos) decreased stress. The core idea is that high population density in confined areas increases animal stress. Among the choices, only **D** directly states that when there are many individuals in a small space, stress increases, which matches the main point of the passage. Other options misrepresent the actions (e.g., increasing population or bringing many new animals) or incorrectly describe population control methods.

The context describes a growing trend where people prioritize staying at home for high-quality rest instead of traveling. It specifically mentions they renovate areas like living rooms or bathrooms and freely spend on expensive furniture (like chairs or beds) to enhance relaxation.  
- Choice A incorrectly states that people value convenience *over* quality, but the context emphasizes a shift *toward* quality.  
- Choice B contradicts the context, which says travel is *decreasing*, not increasing.  
- Choice C claims people *do not* spend much on furniture, but the context says they *do* spend heavily.  
- Choice D accurately reflects the trend of renovating home spaces for rest, as directly stated in the context.

The context describes citizens voluntarily starting movements to preserve culturally and historically valuable assets (land, nature, buildings) that the state fails to manage. It explicitly states that these efforts have led to tangible results, such as the preservation of the rare plant ""매화마름.""  

- **A** is incorrect because the context emphasizes citizens acting *without* state support (""국가에서 관리하지 못하고 있는""), not with it.  
- **B** is incorrect because it suggests citizens are participating *in state management*, but the context states the state is *not* managing these assets.  
- **C** correctly matches: citizens have begun preserving high historical value assets, which aligns with ""사라질 위기에 처해 있는 중요한 자산을 지키기 위해 시민들이 자발적으로 모금에 나선 것이다.""  
- **D** contradicts the context, which confirms rare plant preservation (""희귀식물인 ‘매화마름’이 보존되는 등 가시적인 성과"").

In South Korea's education system, 교육청 (Provincial/Metropolitan Education Office) serves as a local administrative body. Its primary role, as defined by the Education Act, is to oversee and manage educational affairs within its designated region. This includes tasks like teacher assignments, school administration, and implementation of national policies—but the core function is broadly handling regional education matters. Option D directly states ""각지역의 교육에 관한 일을 맡아 보는 것"" (handling regional education affairs), which encompasses the main mandate.

The question asks which industry began developing in South Korea from the 1970s. Historically, South Korea's economic development strategy shifted in the 1970s under President Park Chung-hee toward **heavy and chemical industries (중화학 공업)** to build a stronger industrial base. This included steel, shipbuilding, and chemicals, supported by government policies like the ""Heavy Chemical Industry Promotion Plan.""

The question asks about the main pillar industries of South Korea's economy in the 2010s. Historically, South Korea transitioned from agriculture to industrialization, with manufacturing (especially electronics, automobiles, and shipbuilding) being dominant. By the 2010s, the service sector had also grown significantly, contributing a large portion of GDP alongside manufacturing. Choice A (agriculture and forestry) is incorrect as these sectors are minor. Choice C focuses on light and heavy chemical industries, which were prominent in earlier decades but not the primary dual pillars in the 2010s. Choice D (mining and energy) is inaccurate as South Korea relies on imports for energy and has limited mining. Choice B correctly identifies manufacturing and services as the core industries during that period.

The passage describes a cultural heritage that was created to repel Mongol invasions and was moved from Ganghwa Island to Haeinsa Temple. The event ""Jeongdaebulsa"" involves carrying this heritage on the head. Historically, the **Palmandaejanggyeongpan (팔만대장경판)** refers to the 80,000 wooden printing blocks of the Tripitaka Koreana, carved during the Mongol invasions (13th century) for protective and religious purposes. These blocks were originally carved on Ganghwa Island and later transferred to Haeinsa, where they remain today. This matches the description perfectly. The other options do not fit:  
- **A (초조대장경)**: The first Tripitaka Koreana, destroyed by fire; not the one at Haeinsa.  
- **C (직지심체요절)**: A single printed book, not a large collection moved from Ganghwa.  
- **D (무구정광대다라니경)**: An early printed sutra, unrelated to the Mongol invasion context or Haeinsa's collection.  

Thus, **B** is correct.

The question asks which statement about occupational freedom (직업의 자유) in Korean law is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes that occupational freedom includes business and corporate freedom, allowing free competition. This aligns with constitutional principles (e.g., freedom to engage in economic activities).  
- **Option B** claims occupational freedom includes the right to *demand* a desired job or protection for an existing job. However, occupational freedom in Korean law guarantees the *right to choose* an occupation (negative liberty), **not** a positive right to have a specific job provided or guaranteed job security. This misrepresents the scope of the right, making it incorrect.  
- **Option C** accurately links 공무담임권 (right to hold public office) as a specific manifestation of occupational freedom for public sector roles, which is supported by legal interpretation.  
- **Option D** reflects a real constitutional court ruling (e.g., 2010 decision) that restricting dual-licensed medical professionals to one type of clinic violates occupational freedom. This statement is correct.  

Thus, **B** is the only option with an inaccurate description.

The question asks which statement about 권한쟁의심판 (constitutional complaint adjudication) is incorrect.  

- **Option A** states the claim must be filed within 60 days of awareness or 180 days from occurrence. However, under South Korea’s *Constitutional Court Act* (Article 70), the correct period is **30 days from awareness** and **within 6 months (180 days)** from the occurrence. Thus, ""60 days"" is inaccurate, making this statement incorrect.  
- **Option B** correctly describes that 권한쟁의심판 requires at least 7 judges and decisions are made by majority vote of participating judges in the final hearing.  
- **Option C** is correct: Cancellation of a disposition by the Constitutional Court generally has retroactive effect, invalidating prior legal consequences for the other party.  
- **Option D** is correct: The Court may provisionally suspend the effect of a disposition until the final ruling.  

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is **A**.

- ASEAN is a regional organization focused on Southeast Asia and does not typically hold major summits in South Korea.  
Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

The question asks which description correctly matches a historical figure, specifically referencing Choi Young (최영) mentioned in the dialogue about the Yodong campaign. Choi Young was a prominent Goryeo general in the 14th century. Among the choices:  
- **A** refers to acquiring the Gangdong Six Prefectures. Historically, Choi Young led the 1356 campaign to reclaim these territories from Yuan control, making this accurate.  
- **B** (Thunder Crash Bomb) is attributed to earlier periods or other figures, not Choi Young.  
- **C** (Hwangsan victory) is linked to later figures like Kim Bang-gyeong (1380), not Choi Young.  
- **D** (Maeso Fortress) relates to Red Turban campaigns where Choi Young faced criticism for failures, not victories.  

Thus, only **A** aligns with verified historical achievements of Choi Young.

The question asks which statement about 인용절 (quotation clauses) is correct.  

- **Option A** is incorrect because 직접 인용 표지 ‘(이)라고’ is not a 부사형 어미 (adverbial ending); it is a 접속 어미 (connective ending) used to link quoted speech.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because 의성어 (onomatopoeia) in quotation typically uses 직접 인용, but it is not exclusively restricted to ‘(이)라고’; other structures may apply depending on context.  
- **Option C** is correct because 간접 인용절 (indirect quotation) cannot retain 감탄형 종결 어미 (exclamatory endings like -구나, -아라). Indirect quotations require converting the quoted content into a declarative form (e.g., -다고, -냐고), making exclamatory endings grammatically invalid.  
- **Option D** is incorrect because 직접 인용절 preserves the original speaker’s perspective, including 인칭 대명사 and 시간 표현 (e.g., ""나는 내일"" remains unchanged in direct quotes). Changes occur only in 간접 인용절.  

Thus, the only accurate statement is **C**.

The question asks about processes for university admission in South Korea **besides the Su-neung** (수능), which is the national college entrance exam. In Korean university admissions, institutions often require additional evaluations such as interviews, essays, and personal statements to assess candidates holistically. 

- Option A (""면접, 논술 등"") directly refers to interviews, essays, etc., which are standard supplementary requirements for many Korean universities.
- Options B, C, and D list English proficiency tests (TOEIC, TOEFL, IELTS) or international exams (GRE, GMAT, SAT). These are typically used for specific programs (e.g., English-track courses or graduate studies) but are **not universal requirements** for general undergraduate admission in Korea.

한국의 고등학교 이수 비율이 높은 주된 이유는 전통적으로 교육에 대한 열정과 사회적 중요성이 크기 때문입니다. 한국에서는 교육이 개인의 미래와 사회적 성공에 직결된다고 여겨지며, 특히 대학 진학을 위한 준비 단계로 고등학교 교육이 필수적으로 간주됩니다. 고등학교 교육은 의무 교육이 아니지만(의무교육은 초중등학까지), 사회적 기대와 교육열이 높아 이수율이 높습니다. 따라서 ""교육열이 높아서""가 가장 적절한 답변입니다.

The question asks which financial institution a person dissatisfied with commercial bank (시중은행) interest rates can use. In South Korea, 상호저축은행 (mutual savings banks) are non-bank financial institutions specifically designed to offer competitive interest rates, often higher than those of traditional banks, to attract individual savers and small businesses. While 농협 (A) and 수협 (B) serve agricultural and fisheries sectors and 우체국 (C) offers postal savings, they typically provide more standardized or sector-specific rates that may not consistently outperform commercial banks. 상호저축은행 is the primary alternative for higher-rate savings products.

The question asks which statement about political parties under Korean law is incorrect.  
- **Option A** correctly states that parties must be democratic in purpose, organization, and activities, aligning with constitutional requirements (Article 21).  
- **Option B** accurately describes the process where the government can request dissolution via the Constitutional Court if a party violates democratic principles, and dissolution occurs by the Court’s decision (Article 21(4)).  
- **Option C** claims the National Assembly executes the Constitutional Court’s dissolution decision under the Political Parties Act. However, the Constitution (Article 21(4)) and related laws stipulate that dissolution is directly enforced by the state (executive branch), **not** the National Assembly. This makes C incorrect.  
- **Option D** is valid, as parties receive state protection and financial support under relevant laws.

In South Korean university admissions, special admission categories (특별전형) aim to support underrepresented or disadvantaged groups. Common targets include rural students (농어촌학생), overseas Koreans (재외국민), and vocational high school graduates (특성화고교출신자), as these groups often receive preferential consideration. However, high-income students (고소득층학생) are not a designated special admission group; admissions policies do not favor higher socioeconomic status, as they typically prioritize equity for disadvantaged groups.

The question asks which statement about basic rights in Korean constitutional law is incorrect.  
- Option A claims territorial right (영토권) can be considered a basic right subject to constitutional complaint. However, in Korean constitutional jurisprudence, basic rights (기본권) are individual rights guaranteed to citizens, not state sovereignty rights like territorial integrity. 영토권 is a state attribute, not an individual basic right, so it cannot be a subject of constitutional complaint. Thus, A is incorrect.  
- Option B correctly states that the ""3/1 spirit"" in the preamble is not a basic right subject to constitutional complaint, as preamble provisions are programmatic and not directly enforceable rights.  
- Option C aligns with judicial interpretations that the right to pursue happiness (행복추구권) includes general freedom of action and personality expression.  
- Option D accurately describes peaceful existence right (평화적 생존권) as recognized under Articles 10 and 37, affirmed in precedents regarding protection from forced warfare.

This question asks how to ensure protection for large deposits in the context of Korean economic systems. In Korea, the Deposit Insurance System (예금보험) protects deposits up to a certain limit per financial institution (e.g., up to 1 billion KRW per depositor per bank). If deposits exceed this limit at a single bank, the excess may not be fully protected if the bank fails.

The question asks about the typical cost of lifelong education programs in Korean society. In South Korea, lifelong education programs are often supported by government policies aimed at accessibility and affordability. While not universally free, many public or government-subsidized programs have relatively low tuition fees compared to formal higher education or private institutions. Thus, they are generally considered ""비교적 싸다"" (relatively cheap) rather than very expensive, relatively expensive, or entirely free.

The passage describes a historical text that begins with the ""Giyi (紀異)"" section, which records miraculous births of the founders of the Three Kingdoms, emphasizing heavenly mandates and auspicious signs. This aligns with the **Samguk Sagi** (History of the Three Kingdoms), compiled in the Goryeo period. It is written in the Confucian historiographical tradition (유교적 사관), following the *gijeonche* (기전체, annals-biography) format, which structures history chronologically with records of significant events like marvels.  

Choice A refers to biographies of Buddhist priests (e.g., *Haedong Gosungjeon*), which is unrelated. Choice B describes *Samguk Yusa*, which focuses on Buddhist legends and folklore, not formal historical records with ""Giyi."" Choice C incorrectly states coverage from Gojoseon to late Goryeo, which exceeds the Three Kingdoms scope. Only D accurately reflects the Confucian-based, formal historical compilation described.

- **C** is applied: The text uses rhetorical questions (""여러분도 한 번 읽고 책꽂이에 꽂아 둔 책이...?"", ""혹시 사용하지 않는 물건들이 있나요?"") to engage readers.

The question asks which statement about 고유어 (native Korean words) is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** is correct because 고유어 often exhibit consonant/vowel alternation (e.g., sound changes in conjugation).  
- **Option B** is correct as 고유어 dominate grammatical particles (조사) and basic vocabulary (e.g., body parts, family terms).  
- **Option C** is correct since Korean has rich 의성어/의태어 (e.g., 깜짝, 반짝) and native color terms (e.g., 빨간, 파란).  
- **Option D** is **incorrect**. 한자어 (Sino-Korean words) typically carry more specific, single meanings due to their Chinese roots (e.g., ""학생"" clearly means ""student""), while 고유어 often have broader or multiple meanings (e.g., ""머리"" can mean ""head"" or ""top""). Thus, 고유어 do **not** have more single-meaning words compared to 한자어.

The context states that more people are now watching performances alone, even for genres previously considered for groups (like musicals and plays). A key reason given by solo attendees is that they can focus solely on the performance without worrying about others.  
- Choice A misrepresents the context: it claims people *think* these are solo genres, but the text says they *were* thought of as group genres, now changing.  
- Choice B directly matches the stated advantage (""혼자 공연을 보는 사람들은 함께 간 사람에게 신경을 쓰지 않고 공연에만 집중할 수 있어서 좋다고 말한다"").

- **Option A** is correct: According to the *National Assembly Act*, the Speaker and Deputy Speakers must obtain the consent of the National Assembly to resign.  
- **Option B** is correct: The law prohibits them from holding other positions unless specifically permitted by law, ensuring their focus on legislative duties.  
- **Option C** is **incorrect**: When a member is elected Speaker or Deputy Speaker, they **do not lose their party affiliation**. They retain their party membership but are expected to maintain political neutrality in official duties. The claim that they ""cannot have party affiliation"" during their term contradicts actual practice and legal provisions.

The question concerns the correct description of criminal compensation claim rights under Korean law. Option A is incorrect because compensation claims are filed with the court that rendered the final acquittal judgment, not its superior court. Option B is false since criminal compensation claims *are* a form of state compensation, so claiming one does not preclude the other. Option D is incorrect because agents (e.g., attorneys) are permitted to file claims on behalf of claimants.

The term ""자가 거주"" (self-residence) in Korean context refers to living in a house that one owns. Option A directly states ""자기가 소유한 집에 살고 있는 것"" (living in a house one owns), which matches the definition. Options B, C, and D describe various rental arrangements (e.g., borrowing a deposit, monthly rent, or paying deposit and monthly rent), which are contrary to the concept of owning one's residence.

전세 거주는 한국의 전통적인 임대 방식으로, 임차인이 집주인에게 큰 보증금(전세금)을 맡기고 계약 기간 동안 월세 없이 거주하는 시스템입니다. 선택지 A는 ""집주인에게 보증금을 맡기고 계약기간 동안 집을 빌려서 생활하는 것""으로 전세의 정의에 정확히 부합합니다. 선택지 B는 월세 방식, D는 보증금과 월세를 함께 내는 혼합 방식(주로 월세에 해당), C는 자가 거주를 의미하므로 잘못되었습니다.

한국의 실업률이 상대적으로 낮은 이유는 자영업자 비율이 높기 때문이다. 자영업자는 실업자에 포함되지 않으며, 고용된 인구로 간주되어 실업률을 낮추는 효과가 있다. 또한 한국은 여성의 경제 활동 참가 비율이 다른 선진국에 비해 상대적으로 낮은 편이다. 따라서 여성 참여율이 낮고 자영업자가 많은 것이 실업률이 낮은 주요 원인이다.

The 2010s in South Korea saw increasing economic challenges, including higher youth unemployment rates, slower job creation in traditional sectors, and greater competition due to a highly educated workforce and an aging population. Reports and economic data from that period indicate that securing employment became more difficult, with more applicants competing for fewer positions, especially in stable or prestigious jobs. Therefore, the correct description is that job competition became more intense.

The question asks about the trend of non-regular workers (비정규직 노동자) in South Korea during the 2010s. Data from Statistics Korea and reports from institutions like KEIS show that the proportion of non-regular workers remained high but saw a slight decline over the decade (e.g., approximately 33.8% in 2010 to around 31.3% by 2019). Despite this decrease, non-regular workers continued to face lower wages, job insecurity, and fewer benefits compared to regular workers. Policies under President Moon Jae-in (2017–2022) aimed to reduce irregular work, contributing to the gradual decline. However, even with reduced numbers, their working conditions did not improve significantly relative to regular workers, meaning they still experienced disadvantageous situations. Among the choices, option D correctly captures this trend: a decreasing proportion while still facing unfavorable conditions.

The question asks why there are negative opinions about ""스펙"" (spec) in Korean economic/societal context. In Korea, ""스펙"" refers to formal qualifications like academic credentials, certifications, or job-related specs. Criticism arises because these specs are often seen as proxies for ability but do not truly reflect actual skills or competence. Option A correctly identifies that specs themselves are not equivalent to real ability, which is the core reason for negative perceptions. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: specs *are* heavily required (B is false), they generally help rather than hinder employment (C and D misrepresent the issue).

In the Korean housing system, **월세 (monthly rent)** involves paying a **보증금 (deposit)**, **월세 (monthly rent)** itself, and sometimes **관리비 (management fees)**. **전세금 (jeonse deposit)** is specific to the **전세** system, where a large lump-sum deposit is paid instead of monthly rent. Since the question asks which is *not* a cost in **월세** housing, **전세금** does not apply here.

The question asks about South Korea's housing rental trends as of 2015. Historically, 전세 (key money system with large deposits) dominated the market. However, by 2015, economic pressures made large 전세 deposits increasingly difficult for tenants. This led to a gradual shift toward 월세 (monthly rent with smaller deposits) and 반전세 (a hybrid model combining moderate deposits and monthly rent), which were becoming more accessible. Data from the period indicates that 월세's market share was growing, and 반전세 was also gaining popularity as a flexible alternative. Option A correctly identifies the rising proportions of both 월세 and 반전세. Options B and C incorrectly suggest 전세 or 자가 (owner-occupancy) shares were increasing, which contradicts the trend. Option D incorrectly pairs 월세 growth with 전세 prevalence.

### ANSWER  
A"
KIIP_society_261,Society,0,A,A,"### Reasoning  
The question asks how the deposit (보증금) for ""반전세"" (a hybrid rental system in Korea) is determined. In the Korean rental market:  
- **전세 (jeonse)** requires a very high lump-sum deposit (typically 50-80% of property value), with no monthly rent.  
- **월세 (wolse)** involves a much smaller deposit plus monthly rent payments.  
- **반전세** is not a standard term but contextually refers to a middle-ground system. Logically, its deposit would be **less than 전세** (since it’s not full jeonse) but **more than 월세** (which has the lowest deposit).  
Choice A matches this relationship. Choices B, C, and D contradict typical rental structures.  

### ANSWER  
A"
KIIP_society_262,Society,0,A,A,"### Reasoning
In Korean jeonse (전세) transactions, securing the return of the deposit often hinges on legal evidence of residency. The 전입신고 (change of residence registration) must be completed **after** moving in to officially record the tenant's occupancy at the local office. This generates a 확정일자 (confirmed date), which serves as critical proof in disputes and ensures the landlord cannot unjustly withhold the deposit. Doing it *before* moving (options B/D) is impossible since residency hasn't changed yet. Receiving a 계약서 (contract) alone (options C/D) lacks the legal weight of government-verified residency proof.

The question refers to the rebellion led by Hong Gyeong-rae, which is the Hong Gyeong-rae Rebellion (1811). This uprising occurred primarily in the northern provinces (Pyongan Province), where rebels were driven by severe discrimination, heavy taxation, and exploitation by the Joseon government. Option C correctly identifies that the event arose in response to discrimination against northern residents.  

Option A describes slogans not historically tied to this rebellion. Option B refers to the Hansung Treaty (1882), unrelated to the 1811 event. Option D mentions attacks on the Seonhyeocheong and Japanese legation, which occurred during the Imo Incident (1882), not Hong Gyeong-rae's rebellion.

The question asks how the appearance of a 제사상 (ancestral ritual table) varies in Korean culture. 제사상 traditions are deeply rooted in Korean ancestral rites, and their specific arrangements (such as food offerings, items, and layout) are primarily influenced by regional customs rather than age, gender, or religion. Different regions in Korea (e.g., Jeolla, Gyeongsang, Jeju) have distinct practices due to historical and cultural variations. While age or gender may affect participation roles, they do not dictate the table's appearance. Religion (like Buddhism or Christianity) may alter practices, but 제사 itself is a widespread cultural tradition mainly shaped by geography.

In Korean rental systems, **전세 (jeonse)** involves a large lump-sum deposit (보증금) that is typically much higher than the deposit for **월세 (wolse)**. 월세 usually requires a smaller deposit plus monthly rent payments, while 전세 uses the deposit as a key part of the agreement with no monthly rent (the deposit is returned later).

The question asks which type of housing has increased as population concentrates in Korean cities. In urban areas like Seoul, limited space and high population density led to the rapid development of large-scale high-rise apartments (대규모 고층 아파트). These structures efficiently accommodate many residents vertically, unlike single-detached homes (단독주택), row houses (연립주택), or multi-household units (다가구주택), which are less common in dense city centers.

The question asks which option groups pairs that share the same subtype of antonyms (반의어). Antonyms have subtypes:  
- **Relational antonyms**: Pairs representing reciprocal relationships (e.g., buyer-seller).  
- **Gradable antonyms**: Pairs on a spectrum (e.g., big-small).  
- **Complementary antonyms**: Mutually exclusive pairs (e.g., alive-dead).  

Analyzing each option:  
- **A**: 신랑 - 신부 (groom-bride) and 사다 - 팔다 (buy-sell) are both **relational antonyms** (roles/actions in reciprocal relationships).  
- **B**: 출석 - 결석 (attendance-absence) is complementary; 넓다 - 좁다 (wide-narrow) is gradable → different subtypes.  
- **C**: 남자 - 여자 (man-woman) is complementary; 부모 - 자식 (parents-children) is relational → different subtypes.

- Option A matches the description: the technique makes pictures feel softer (""부드럽게 느껴진다"").  
- Option B is incorrect because the text states it remains popular (""현대 화가들도 즐겨 사용하고 있다"").  
- Option C is wrong because the effect occurs when viewed *from a distance* (""조금 떨어진 곳에서""), not up close.  
- Option D contradicts the text, which specifies dots are placed *closely* (""촘촘히 찍어서""), not with wide spacing.

The context explains that certain organisms act as indicators of environmental pollution. Specifically, fish types indicate water pollution levels: silverfish (은어) mean clean 1st-grade water, while loaches (미꾸라지) mean polluted 3rd-grade water. This directly supports option C, which states that water pollution can be determined by the type of fish present. Option A contradicts the context (it says air pollution is hard to detect, but 나팔꽃 is used). Option B is false (미꾸라지 indicates polluted water, not clean). Option D incorrectly refers to ""size changes"" instead of white spots for 나팔꽃.

The task requires selecting the presentation plan that correctly aligns the keyword, its definition, and relevant research content focused on the capital region (수도권). 

- **Option A**: 다핵화 (multi-nucleation) concept is valid, but researching Seoul's central green spaces does not effectively illustrate multiple urban nuclei; it focuses narrowly on the central area rather than multiple centers.
- **Option B**: 침상도시 (satellite city) is defined as a self-sufficient city separate from the central city, but commuter data to Seoul contradicts this by showing dependence, not self-sufficiency.
- **Option C**: 탈공업화 (deindustrialization) concept fits, and factory area changes could support it. However, deindustrialization is less central to 수도권 geography compared to urban spatial expansion.
- **Option D**: 열섬현상 (urban heat island) is misdefined—it describes temperature inversion causing fog, which is incorrect. The actual phenomenon relates to urban warmth, and yellow dust data is unrelated.
- **Option E**: 교외화 (suburbanization) is correctly defined as the spread of population/functions to surrounding areas. Research on agricultural land changes in 수도권 directly reflects suburbanization (e.g., farmland decreasing due to urban sprawl), making it the most coherent and relevant choice.

The term ""손 없는 날"" (son-eomneun nal) refers to specific days in the Korean lunar calendar considered unlucky for starting new activities or events. These days are traditionally associated with dates where the numbering involves transitions that metaphorically imply ""missing hands"" in Korean hand-counting gestures. In Korean culture, days ending in 9 and 10 (i.e., 9th, 10th), as well as their counterparts in later parts of the month (19th, 20th, 29th, 30th), are regarded as ""손 없는 날"" because they align with points where hand-counting resets or lacks stability.

- **B: 포장이사 서비스** (Packing and moving service) specializes in handling large amounts of luggage, packing, and transporting them quickly, ideal for time-constrained situations.  
- **C: 대리운전 서비스** (Designated driving service) focuses on driving people (e.g., when intoxicated), not transporting luggage.  
- **D: 배달 서비스** (Delivery service) typically refers to food or goods delivery to a location, not moving personal belongings.  

Thus, **B** is the most appropriate choice for efficiently moving many items with limited time.

- **Option A** aligns with precedents (e.g., Constitutional Court decisions) that forcing a lawyer to sit behind a suspect unjustly infringes the right to defense, making it correct.  
- **Option B** claims that foreign punishment consideration is unnecessary and does not violate bodily freedom. However, Korean law (Criminal Act Art. 10) requires consideration of foreign sentences to avoid double jeopardy; ignoring it entirely would constitute excessive deprivation, making this statement incorrect.  
- **Option C** correctly reflects the Criminal Procedure Act, allowing post-warrant arrest for 현행범인 or severe crimes with flight risk.  
- **Option D** is accurate, as the Constitutional Court interprets ""구속"" in Art. 12(4) to include both judicial and administrative detentions.

The passage emphasizes the distinction between fundamental, unchanging moral principles (도, *The Way*)—such as ethical relationships (군신, 부자, etc.)—and practical, external elements (기, *material things*) like ships, machinery, or agriculture. This reflects the Neo-Confucian concept of separating eternal moral truth (리, *li*) from adaptable material aspects (기, *qi*). Historically, this idea aligned with the ""동도서기"" (Eastern ethics, Western technology) argument during Korea’s late Joseon period, which justified adopting Western innovations (e.g., technology, military methods) while preserving Confucian moral values. Among the choices, **B** correctly identifies this as the ideological basis for accepting modern civilization. Other options are incorrect: A refers to ruler-subject unity (not the focus), C misattributes it to the radical Gabo Reformers (who sought broader changes), and D describes social hierarchy unrelated to the 도-기 distinction.

The question describes South Korea's population pyramid evolution. In the early 1960s, Korea was in a traditional society stage, characterized by a pyramid shape. This occurs when both birth rate (출산율) and death rate (사망률) are **high**—wide base due to many births and rapid narrowing due to higher mortality in older age groups. Thus, (ㄱ) must be ""높은"" (high) and (ㄴ) ""높은"" (high).  

By the 1990s, Korea transitioned to a column-shaped (종형) structure, typical of developed societies with **low** birth and death rates, reflecting stabilized population across age groups. Therefore, (ㄷ) and (ㄹ) should both be ""낮은"" (low).

- **ㄱ (냉전 질서의 강화)**: Incorrect. The 1990s saw the *end* of the Cold War, not its strengthening; this contradicts the era's context.  
- **ㄴ (물질적 풍요와 개인적 자유의 확대)**: Correct. Economic prosperity and expanded individual freedoms defined the 1990s youth culture.  
- **ㄷ (권위주의의 약화)**: Correct. The democratization after 1987 reduced authoritarian influence, aligning with 신세대 values.  
- **ㄹ (영상문화에서 문자중심 문화로의 전환)**: Incorrect. The 1990s saw a *shift toward* visual/media culture (e.g., music videos, TV), not text-centered.  
- **ㅁ (디지털 매체의 확산)**: Correct. Early internet and digital media growth in the late 1990s was central to youth trends.

The question asks which statement about 개인정보자기결정권 (right to personal information self-determination) is **incorrect**. 

- **Option A** claims that Article 13, Paragraph 1 violates the principle of proportionality and infringes on 개인정보자기결정권. However, **Article 13 of the Korean Constitution** pertains to the right against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings, not personal information rights. There is **no major constitutional court ruling** that declares Article 13 unconstitutional for violating 개인정보자기결정권. This makes A factually incorrect.

- **Option B** correctly reflects court rulings (e.g., 2020다228882) where public disclosure of teachers’ union membership data violated privacy rights.
- **Option C** accurately defines 개인정보자기결정권 as derived from Articles 10 and 17 of the Constitution, consistent with established jurisprudence.
- **Option D** aligns with the 2011 Constitutional Court decision (2007헌마1057) that indefinite DNA data retention violates proportionality and personal rights.

- **Option A** aligns with Article 72 of the Constitution, which states that the president may submit important policies (e.g., foreign affairs, national defense) to a national referendum **with the consent of the National Assembly**. This is correct.  
- **Option B** reflects the *Former Presidents Act*, which stipulates that a president removed via impeachment loses all honors except necessary security. This is accurate.  
- **Option C** claims the president alone can ""declare war and conclude peace."" However, **Article 73** of the Constitution explicitly requires the president to obtain **National Assembly consent** for declaring war and concluding peace. The option omits this critical condition, making it **incorrect**.  
- **Option D** correctly describes the president’s constitutional duty to pursue peaceful unification, affirmed by the inauguration oath (Article 70).

The question asks which student(s) correctly identified characteristics of Korea's 2010 summer based on the provided data. Key data points:
- **Temperature**: Average temperature was 24.8°C (1.3°C above normal), with 81 of 92 days warmer than average. This strongly supports **을 (tropical night occurrences increased)**, as higher temperatures—especially nighttime lows—directly correlate with more tropical nights (minimum temperature ≥25°C).
- **Precipitation**: Total rainfall was similar to normal, but **heavy rain events increased** (1-hour rainfall ≥30mm occurred 2.2 days vs. 1.4 normal). This directly matches **정 (frequency of concentrated heavy rain increased)**.
- **Solar radiation (갑)**: More rainy days (44.2 vs. normal) suggest increased cloud cover, likely *reducing* solar radiation—not increasing it. Thus, 갑 is incorrect.
- **North Pacific high (병)**: While a weak North Pacific high *could* explain increased rainfall, the question asks for **observed characteristics**, not underlying causes. 병’s statement describes a meteorological cause, not a direct observable trait, making it inappropriate for the teacher’s question.

Thus, only **을** and **정** are valid answers, corresponding to choice **D**.

The passage explains that while statistics are used to understand reality, they do not always reflect absolute truth. It provides an example where cucumber prices (1,000 won in January, 3,000 won in February, and 2,000 won currently) lead to different interpretations depending on the chosen baseline: compared to January, prices seem to have risen sharply, while compared to February, they appear to have dropped significantly. This illustrates that statistical interpretation varies based on the reference point or criteria used. Among the choices, option D directly captures this idea—that statistics can be interpreted differently depending on how criteria are set. Option A contradicts the passage’s caution about statistics not being absolute. Option B overstates by calling such statistics ""meaningless,"" which the passage does not claim. Option C focuses only on the ability to measure price changes, missing the core point about interpretation variability.

The question asks which effect of industrialization in Korea since the 1960s is **not observable**.  

- **Option A** reflects urbanization, a well-documented outcome as rural populations migrated to cities for factory jobs. This is observable.  
- **Option B** claims the gap between large enterprises and SMEs (""부익부 빈익빈 현상"") eased. Historically, Korea’s industrialization strengthened chaebols, *widening* disparities—SMEs remained vulnerable. This easing did **not** occur, making it unobservable.  
- **Option C** correctly notes the sharp decline in agricultural/fishery workers due to industrialization. This is observable.  
- **Option D** aligns with the 1970s consumer boom (e.g., appliances), changing household consumption. This is observable.  

Thus, **B** is the least accurate description.

The question asks which statement about Korea's baby boom generation is correct.  
- Option A is incorrect because Korea's baby boomers resulted from post-war population growth, not specific government childbirth encouragement policies (which came later to *reduce* birth rates).  
- Option B is inaccurate; Korean baby boomers are generally defined as those born **between 1955 and 1963** (post-Korean War), not 1946–1954.  
- Option C is false; college enrollment rates exceeding 60% and ""education inflation"" concerns emerged in the **1990s–2000s**, affecting later generations (Gen X/Y), not baby boomers.  
- Option D is correct: Born during high birth-rate years (1950s–1960s), this large cohort faced intense competition in education and employment.

- **Option C** (increase in remote workers) aligns with trends like telecommuting enabled by internet connectivity.  
- **Option D** (active foreign contact) reflects global communication and cultural exchange via the internet.  
- **Option A** (worsening environmental pollution) is **not** a direct or typical social phenomenon caused by smartphone/internet usage. While e-waste or energy use could relate, it is not a primary societal outcome highlighted in this context, making it the incorrect association.

The question asks which option **inappropriately** summarizes the key arguments (쟁점) from the opening statements in (가). We must verify if each choice accurately reflects the stated positions.

- **Choice A** correctly describes 반대 1's argument about technical flaws causing inconvenience, which matches the context (""기술적 결함이 발생할 수 있습니다... 지원자들에게 불편을 줄 수 있다"").
- **Choice B** accurately summarizes 찬성 1’s economic argument (cost savings via reduced manpower, with a specific example of 2 billion won saved).
- **Choice C** correctly captures 반대 1’s counterpoint that short-term savings may cause missing future talent, making it uneconomical long-term (""장기적 인 관점에서 보아야 한다... 미래에 더 큰 경제적 가치를 창출할 인재를 놓치게 돼"").
- **Choice D** properly reflects 찬성 1’s claim about objectivity (AI uses consistent big-data criteria, avoiding interviewer subjectivity).
- **Choice E** misrepresents 반대 1’s argument. 반대 1 argues that **big data itself may be biased** (""빅데이터는 사회에서 형성된 정보가 축적된 결과물로서 특정 대상과 사안에 치우친 것일 수 있습니다""), **not** that evaluations are based *without* big data. The phrase ""빅데이터에 근거하지 않고"" (""not based on big data"") is factually incorrect, as 반대 1 explicitly acknowledges AI relies on big data but claims it may be distorted.

In the 1980s, South Korea underwent significant demographic changes due to industrialization, urbanization, and government family planning policies. The total fertility rate (TFR) dropped from around 4-5 children per woman in the early 1980s to about 2.7 by the late 1980s. This places the typical family size in the range of 3-5 children during that decade, aligning with historical data on declining birth rates.

The question asks which statement about the urban hierarchy in Korea is incorrect. The hierarchy is structured as ᄀ (eup/myeon, lowest level), ᄂ (small/medium cities), local hub cities, and ᄃ (metropolitan cities, highest level). In central place theory, higher-order centers (like ᄃ) have larger hinterlands, greater spacing, and host high-order functions with large minimum requirements.  

- **Option A** claims ᄀ has a wider hinterland than ᄂ. However, since ᄂ is a higher-level center than ᄀ, it should have a wider hinterland. This statement is incorrect.  
- **Option B** is correct because rural areas (ᄀ) have more primary industry workers than metropolitan cities (ᄃ).  
- **Option C** is correct as higher-order cities (ᄃ) are spaced farther apart than lower-order ones (ᄂ).  
- **Option D** is correct because metropolitan cities host high-order functions requiring large populations.  
- **Option E** aligns with the gravity model, where interaction (ᄅ) increases with city size and decreases with distance.  

Thus, the only incorrect statement is **A**.

This occurs before the actual wedding ceremony.  

- Choice A describes 나례 (narye), the initial investigation of backgrounds.

- Choice C refers to a later step like 신정 (sinjeong), where the groom visits the bride's home.

The Constitution limits 권한쟁의심판 to specific state organs (President, National Assembly, Courts, Election Commission), but A's reasoning is flawed due to the wrong article reference. Option B is incorrect because political parties are not constitutional state organs and lack standing. Option C is invalid as 교섭단체 (negotiation groups) are not direct parties under constitutional provisions.

The passage defines 보편적 디자인 (universal design) as creating products or environments usable by everyone regardless of gender, age, or disability. It criticizes the industrial revolution era for prioritizing production efficiency, which excluded certain groups. Universal design emerged from this criticism to include diverse populations (e.g., children, elderly, disabled people), as exemplified by low-floor buses. The main theme emphasizes that universal design considers various social groups to ensure accessibility for all. Among the choices, C directly aligns with this core idea, while A is partially related but less focused on the inclusive nature highlighted in the text. B and D contradict the passage's message.

### ANSWER

The context explains that during the industrial revolution, design focused on mass production and efficiency. This approach led to inconvenience for those not fitting the norm. The key phrase is ""그러다 보니 여기에 속하지 못한 대상들은 불편을 겪을 수밖에 없었다,"" which indicates exclusion of non-standard groups. Among the choices, D (""표준이라 여기는 다수만을 기준으로 하였다"") directly matches this idea—designing based only on the majority standard, which aligns with the cause of exclusion described.

The passage discusses the original purpose of patents—promoting technological progress through disclosure—but highlights a recent distortion where people prioritize securing patent rights over actual innovation.

The passage discusses how the original purpose of patents—promoting technological advancement by requiring disclosure—is being undermined. Specifically, it criticizes situations where people file patents prematurely to secure rights before actually developing the technology. The phrase ""(    )상태에서"" describes the condition where reckless patent applications occur despite incomplete development. Among the choices, **C (""기술이 완벽하게 개발되지 않은"" - technology not fully developed)** directly matches this context, as it highlights the problem of claiming rights before the technology is properly created, which aligns with the described abuse of the patent system.

- Option C is incorrect because the Political Affairs Committee (정무위원회) oversees executive branch matters but does not specifically manage the President’s or Prime Minister’s secretariats.  
- Option D is false; subcommittees can operate during recess, and there is no strict rule requiring bill-review subcommittees to meet twice monthly.  

Thus, only option B is correct.

The question asks which term is *not* correctly used between spouses after having a child in Korean culture.  
- **Option A (여보)**: A common affectionate term between couples, widely accepted.  
- **Option B (당신)**: Though formal, it can still be used in some families, though less intimate. It is not strictly *incorrect*.  
- **Option C (◯◯아빠, ◯◯엄마)**: Refers to using the child’s name followed by ""dad/mom"" (e.g., ""민수아빠""). This is a common and culturally accepted practice after childbirth.  
- **Option D (엄마, 아빠)**: These are terms *children* use for their parents. Spouses do **not** address each other as ""엄마"" or ""아빠""; it is socially inappropriate and incorrect in this context.  

Thus, the only term that is *not* correct for spouses to use after having a child is **D**.

The question asks which statement about South Korea's international contributions is incorrect.  
- Option A correctly describes KOICA's role in sharing development experience.  
- Option B claims the Zaytun Unit was dispatched for peacekeeping in Afghanistan. However, the Zaytun Unit (2004-2008) was primarily a **civilian reconstruction team** focused on building infrastructure and providing medical aid, not a military peacekeeping force. South Korea's overseas deployments for peacekeeping are limited and typically under UN mandates; this unit was a bilateral reconstruction effort. Thus, describing it as aiming for ""평화유지"" (peacekeeping) is inaccurate.  
- Option C is correct: South Korea joined the OECD DAC in 2010.  
- Option D is correct: The Green Climate Fund (GCF) secretariat is indeed located in Songdo, Incheon.

- Option C is correct: Over half of long-term foreign residents live in the Seoul Capital Area (Sudogwon), as it is the economic hub.  
- Option D is correct: Multicultural family support centers explicitly provide Korean language education for marriage immigrants.

The question asks which statement correctly describes literature during the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392).  
- Option A (Pansori-based novels) is incorrect because pansori and related novels developed prominently in the Joseon Dynasty, not Goryeo.  
- Option C (women's essay literature development) is inaccurate; while some female writers existed, essay-style ""supil"" literature did not notably flourish in Goryeo.  
- Option D (commoner writers leading to sijo prosperity) is wrong because sijo became mainstream in Joseon, and Goryeo literature was dominated by the aristocracy, not commoners.  
- Option B refers to the emergence of ""paegwan munhak"" (literature by dismissed or retired officials) and ""gajanche munhak"" (family-tradition literature), which aligns with Goryeo's historical context where scholars in exile or retirement produced significant works, and familial literary traditions began to form.

- **A: 아가씨** is used for an unmarried young woman, not appropriate for addressing an elder sister-in-law.
- **B: 형님** is a respectful term used to address an older sibling of one's spouse, especially for an older sister of the husband. It is commonly used by a wife for her husband's older sister.
- **C: 아주버님** refers specifically to a paternal aunt (father's sister), not applicable here.
- **D: 도련님** is used for young children or descendants, not for an older sister-in-law.

The question asks how family and relative relationships are indicated in Korean society. In Korean kinship terminology, ""촌수"" (chonshu) specifically refers to the degree or count of generational distance between relatives (e.g., 일촌 for first cousins, 이촌 for second cousins). This system is traditionally used to precisely describe familial relationships. ""세대"" (generation) refers to lineage depth but not the specific relational degree. ""계급"" (class) and ""등급"" (rank) are unrelated to kinship terms.

- **Option B** states that Chinese nationals are the largest group among foreign-national Koreans residing in Korea as of 2019. This aligns with migration data, so it is correct.  
- **Option C** correctly notes that the Act on the Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Koreans was enacted in 1999 to protect their rights.  
- **Option D** accurately reflects the law: Korean nationals holding overseas permanent residency are **not** classified as ""재외동포"" because they retain Korean citizenship, and the term applies to non-citizen ethnic Koreans.

The sentence describes that guide dogs for the visually impaired normally do not pay attention to pedestrians when with their owner. The connector at the blank should introduce an explanation about what it means if the dog *does* approach a pedestrian. ""물론"" (of course) is used to emphasize a general truth or expected behavior, which fits here to contrast the normal behavior with the exceptional case described next. ""비록"" (although) implies contrast that doesn't match the context. ""만약"" (if) is redundant because the following clause already starts with ""다면"" (if).

The question asks why the gap in economic activity rates between women and men decreased in Korea compared to the early 20th century. Historically, early 20th-century Korea had very limited female participation in the workforce due to traditional gender roles. Over time, factors like education expansion, industrialization, and social changes led to increased female labor force participation. This directly reduced the disparity, as men’s participation remained relatively stable or high. Option A correctly identifies increased women’s social/economic participation as the cause. Options B, C, and D are implausible: men’s participation did not significantly decrease (B), population growth (C) does not directly affect participation rate gaps, and overall economic activity increased rather than decreased (D).

In South Korea during the 2010s, there was a strong cultural and economic preference for working at large corporations (대기업). These companies, such as Samsung, Hyundai, and SK, offer job stability, comprehensive benefits, social prestige, and clear career progression. While startups and foreign companies gained some popularity, they were generally seen as riskier. Small and medium enterprises (중소기업) typically offered less stability and lower benefits compared to large firms. Thus, the most desired employer type was large corporations.

The question asks who constituted the majority of workers in South Korea during the 1980s. This period was marked by rapid industrialization, where manufacturing and heavy industries expanded significantly. Historically, South Korea's workforce during this era was predominantly male, as societal norms and labor structures heavily favored men in formal employment. While women participated in the workforce (especially in textiles and manufacturing), they were not the majority. Child and elderly labor were not primary contributors to the mainstream workforce at that time.

- **조왕신 (Jowangshin)** is the kitchen god, traditionally linked to the kitchen (부엌) where the hearth or stove is located. This pairing is well-established in Korean folk belief.  
- **성주신 (Seongjushin)** is the guardian deity of the house, usually associated with the main gate or entrance, not the 장독대 (fermentation pot stand).  
- **터주신 (Teojushin)** relates to the earth/ground spirit, often connected to the courtyard or foundation, not the 곳간 (storage room).

- **Option B (손 기술 - 앞무릎치기)**: ""앞무릎치기"" (striking the front knee) is performed using hands to push or hit the knee, fitting ""손 기술"" (hand technique). Correct match.  
- **Option C (허리 기술 - 들배지기)**: ""들배지기"" (lifting the belly/waist) uses waist movement, aligning with ""허리 기술"". Correct match.

High school enrollment (C) is also close to universal and has been balanced earlier.

However, in recent decades, economic pressures and changing social norms have led to a rise in dual-income households. Current data (e.g., from Korean government statistics) shows that ""맞벌이 부부"" (both spouses working) has become the predominant type in modern Korean society.

- **Option C** claims that (c) (""필자의 주장을 뒷받침할 근거를 제시하였는가?"") is satisfied because it cites ""획일화된 장소에 식상함을 느낀 사람들이 장소의 선택권을 요구했다는 점"" as evidence. However, the draft (나) **does not mention people demanding a ""right to choose places.""** It only states that people get tired of similar places and stop visiting (""싫증을 느낀 사람들은 더 이상 그곳을 찾지 않게 되고""), which leads to reduced economic benefits.

  - B: The negative perspective on homogenization is consistent.

The question asks which statement correctly describes freedom of occupation under Korean law, referencing precedents where applicable. 

- **Option A** is overly vague and lacks specific legal context, making it an incomplete or incorrect explanation.
- **Option B** claims that requiring lawyers to submit litigation proof for prison visits does not infringe professional freedom. However, precedents generally uphold such administrative requirements for security, so this may be valid, but it is not the strongest example of occupational freedom infringement.
- **Option C** argues that requiring guardians on children's buses infringes occupational freedom. Safety regulations like this are typically justified under public interest and do not constitute unlawful infringement, so this statement is incorrect.
- **Option D** addresses the Pharmacy Act provision restricting pharmacy ownership to licensed pharmacists only. The Korean Constitutional Court (e.g., Decision 2009헌가12) ruled this ban unconstitutional, as it unjustly limits occupational freedom and freedom of association for pharmacists seeking to form corporate entities. This aligns with precedent and accurately describes an infringement.

Thus, **D** is the correct choice as it reflects an established precedent where the law was found to violate occupational freedom.

The question asks which statement correctly describes equality rights under Korean law, referencing precedents. Option A aligns with established Constitutional Court precedents (e.g., Decision 2005Hun-Ka1785 in 2006), which upheld that differential treatment of elementary/middle school teachers (prohibited from political party membership) versus university professors (allowed) is constitutional. The Court recognized distinct job functions—teachers' direct influence on young children versus professors' research focus—as a rational basis, not violating equality. Other options misrepresent precedents: B incorrectly claims age discrimination in participatory courts (the age limit was deemed reasonable for maturity); C overstates strictness in punishment proportionality (not an absolute ""no error"" principle); D misjudges differing holiday treatments (rational distinctions between public servants and workers are permitted).

The headline ""제2공장 정상 가동, 반도체 공급 안정은 미지수"" translates to ""Second factory operating normally, semiconductor supply stability remains uncertain.""  
- Option A incorrectly states that supply *has stabilized*, contradicting ""미지수"" (uncertain).

- Option C focuses on necessity (""필수적이다""), which isn't the headline's main point.

The question asks which statement about ""두레"" (Dure), a traditional Korean rural mutual-aid cooperative, is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes Dure as a rural mutual-aid organization.  
- **Option C** lists activities like 모내기 (rice planting), 김매기 (seaweed gathering), and 타작 (threshing). While 모내기 and 타작 are core agricultural tasks of Dure, **김매기** (seaweed gathering) is specific to coastal areas and not a typical activity of inland farming-focused Dure. However, regional variations might include it, so this is not the *most clearly incorrect*.  
- **Option D** accurately reflects the communal meals and festivities after labor, a well-documented aspect of Dure.  
- **Option B** claims Dure involved ""공동 양육과 교육"" (joint child-rearing and education). **This is historically inaccurate**—Dure was strictly for labor exchange among adults during farming peaks, with no role in education or child-rearing. Thus, B is the **incorrect** description.

The question asks which statement about 동지 (winter solstice) is incorrect.  
- Option A refers to historical terminology from *Dongguk sesigi*; this is accurate as ""아세"" is a documented alternate name.  
- Option B claims 동지 always falls on December 22 in the Gregorian calendar. However, 동지 is a solar term whose exact date varies yearly (typically between Dec 21–23), so stating it is specifically ""12월 22일"" is incorrect.  
- Option C describes the tradition of lighting lamps throughout the house, including outer areas, which aligns with Korean customs for 동지.  
- Option D (though partially cut off) likely describes a valid tradition (e.g., opening gates for ancestral rites), which is correct.

The question asks which statement about Japan's policy changes in Korea after the March 1st Movement (1919) is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes the shift from military rule (*무단통치*) to cultural rule (*문화통치*) due to the ineffectiveness of harsh governance.  
- **Option B** is accurate, as Japan temporarily relaxed press restrictions, allowing Korean-language newspapers (e.g., *The Dong-a Ilbo*) to publish.  
- **Option C** is also correct: the *헌병경찰제* (gendarmerie system) was replaced by a civilian *보통경찰제* (ordinary police system) in 1919 to soften control.  
- **Option D** is **incorrect**. The *산미증식계획* (mountainous area expansion plan) aimed to increase agricultural output for **Japan’s benefit**, not Korea’s food security. In reality, colonial policies prioritized exporting rice to Japan, worsening Korea’s food situation rather than improving it.

The context states that in mathematics, concepts are usually established before symbols. However, for infinity, the opposite occurred: the symbol appeared before the concept was solidified. The sentence ""무한대는() 후에도 한동안 개념이 정립되지 못했다"" requires an event after which the concept still wasn't established. Given that the symbol (기호) was created first, choice A (""기호가 만들어진"") fits logically. The passage explains that scholars avoided defining infinity due to its perceived incomprehensibility, so even after the symbol's creation, the concept remained unsettled. Other options (B, C, D) contradict the context.

- Option A is incorrect because the adult lifespan is 1-2 weeks, not strictly one day (the name is misleading).  
- Option B is wrong as it takes about one year for larvae to become adults, not 1-2 weeks.

This caused problems with railroads, as companies used their headquarters' local time, leading to passenger inconvenience. To resolve this, a Canadian railroad engineer proposed standard time based on longitude. 

- Option A correctly states that the need for standard time arose in the railroad sector, matching the context.
- Option B is incorrect because railroad companies used their own local time, not determined regional standard time.
- Option C is false, as standard time was proposed in the mid-19th century, not used before that.

The question asks which statement about *ondol* (Korean traditional underfloor heating) is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** claims *ondol* was first introduced during the Mongol invasions of the Goryeo period. However, historical records show *ondol* originated much earlier, during the Goguryeo period (37 BCE–668 CE), and was already widespread by the Three Kingdoms era. The Mongol invasions occurred in the 13th century, so this statement is factually wrong.  
- **Option B** correctly describes *ondol* as a system where heat from the *agungi* (fireplace) warms the entire floor by passing underneath.  
- **Option C** accurately lists the basic components: *agungi* (fireplace), *gudeul* (heat passages), and *gulttuk* (smoke outlet, often interpreted as part of the structure).  
- **Option D** is true, as most Korean homes historically and even in modern times use *ondol*-style heating.

In Korean workplace culture, honorific language (높임말) is primarily used when addressing individuals of higher status or position. The key principle is hierarchy rather than age alone. While age can influence speech in broader social contexts, in a corporate setting, 높임말 is strictly expected when communicating with 상사 (superiors). Using it for colleagues, even if older, is not mandatory unless they also hold a higher position. Thus, the most accurate answer focuses on superiors only.

In Korean workplace culture, hierarchy and respect are paramount.

Common examples include ""과장님"" (section chief) or ""대리님"" (assistant manager), which directly reference job rank. While honorifics (호칭) are used, they are usually attached to the position title, making the primary method based on 직급.

In Korean workplace culture, formal hierarchy is initially maintained using titles (직급) or honorifics (호칭). However, as colleagues become closer, they often shift to more intimate forms of address. Common practices include using ""형님"" (for males) or ""언니"" (for females) to denote seniority and closeness, or directly using names to foster familiarity.

The question asks which data utilization plan is **inappropriate** for supplementing the student's draft. The draft (나) explains gamification's characteristics:  
- It provides interesting tasks to spark curiosity, induces competition, and gives rewards (성취감) to increase immersion.  
- It gives examples in education, health, and marketing.  
- It emphasizes that gamification must align with its purpose and wisely use elements like excitement, challenge, competition, and rewards.  

Now evaluating the options:  
- **A** appropriately extends the ""various fields"" point by adding environmental applications (ㄱ). This aligns with the draft’s scope.  
- **B** correctly uses expert insight (ㄴ) about immediate feedback/rewards to reinforce the ""reward"" characteristic in the draft.  
- **C** properly uses research data (ㄷ) showing improved academic performance to support gamification’s educational effectiveness, which matches the history class example.  
- **D** suitably combines ㄱ (reward via 성취감/보람) and ㄴ (rewards boost focus) to back the ""rewards increase immersion"" claim in the draft.  
- **E** is problematic: It claims to use ㄴ (rewards → focus) and ㄷ (motivation/academic scores increased) to argue *""higher motivation leads to greater 성취감 (emotional feeling) from task choices.""* However, ㄷ only provides **quantitative academic achievement data** (학업성취도 scores), not evidence about emotional 성취감.

- **Option C** is accurate: Jongmyo was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and rebuilt in the early 17th century (completed in 1601).  
- **Option D** is also correct: Jongmyo was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.  
- **Option B** contains errors. Jongmyo was initially called *Taemyo*, but **Jeongjeon** (the main hall) was **not** built as a separate shrine (*별묘*) to the west of Taemyo. Instead, Jeongjeon is the **original main hall** of Jongmyo itself, constructed in 1395 as part of the Taemyo complex. The phrasing ""별묘인 정전"" (a separate shrine called Jeongjeon) is incorrect because Jeongjeon is integral to Jongmyo, not a separate site.

The question asks which statement about cultural heritage in Korea is incorrect.  
- Option A correctly defines intangible cultural heritage as inherited traditions.  
- Option C is accurate: Sungnyemun (Namdaemun) is designated as Treasure No. 1 in Korea.  
- Option D is correct: Bulguksa's Dabotap is National Treasure No. 20.  
- Option B is incorrect because **국가지정문화재** (state-designated cultural properties) are officially designated by the **Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism**, not the 문화재청장 (Chairman of the Cultural Heritage Administration). The 문화재청장 administers recommendations and management but lacks final designation authority.

The question asks which statement about Korean dietary habits is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A**: Correct. Beer production in Korea began post-liberation (1945) with U.S. military support, such as the establishment of breweries like Dongseo Beer (later OB Beer).  
- **Option B**: Correct. Instant ramen was first produced in 1963 by Samyang Foods using U.S.-supplied wheat aid, aligning with historical records.  
- **Option C**: Correct. In the 1960s, rice shortages led to government policies banning the use of white rice for alcohol production to conserve food resources.  
- **Option D**: **Incorrect**. The *혼분식장려운동* (mixed-meal encouragement movement) aimed to reduce rice consumption by mixing grains (e.g., barley) into rice, not to popularize *자장면* (jjambbong). *자장면* spread due to Chinese immigration and restaurant culture, not this movement.  

Thus, D is the false statement.

The question asks how the student appropriately used materials in the presentation. In part (ㄱ), the student explicitly states, ""지금 보시는 화면이 수라상의 사진인데요, 세 개의 상과 화로를 한눈에 볼 수 있습니다,"" and then explains the arrangement of the tables (대원반, 소원반) and the 화로. This shows the photo was used to display the overall setup of 수라상, not for explaining cooking processes or meal times. Option B correctly matches this usage. Other options misrepresent the purpose: A incorrectly ties the photo to 전골 preparation, C and D misattribute the photos in (ㄴ) to 수라상 or incorrect purposes, and E confuses the video in (ㄷ) with setup process.

The question refers to the 2018 inter-Korean summit agreement. The suspended tourism project (가) is **금강산 (Kumgang Mountains)**, which was designated as a tourism zone in 2002. The location where the leaders took a photo with ""천지"" (Cheonji) as the backdrop (나) is **백두산 (Mount Paektu)**, which features **천지 (Cheonji Lake)**, a caldera lake formed from a collapsed volcanic crater.  

Option C correctly states that (나)'s summit has a caldera lake, matching Mount Paektu’s geography. Other options are incorrect:  
- A is wrong because 백두대간 starts at 백두산, not 금강산.  
- B misrepresents 금강산’s geology (it is limestone-based, not gneiss-derived soil).  
- D is false as 백두산 (2,744 m) is higher than 금강산 (~1,638 m).  
- E is incorrect since neither is in 관서 (northwestern region).

The passage describes the core ideology of **Donghak (Eastern Learning)**, emphasizing human equality (""사람이 곧 하늘이라""), rejection of social discrimination, and following sage teachings. This aligns with the foundational beliefs of Choe Je-u's Donghak movement in the 19th century. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because major suppression of Donghak occurred later (e.g., 1864 under Heungseon Daewongun), not during/after Sunjo's reign (1834–1849), as Donghak emerged in 1860.
- **Option B** is correct: The key Donghak scriptures **""동경대전"" (Donggyeong Daejeon)** and **""용담유사"" (Yongdam Yusa)** were compiled to systematize its teachings, directly reflecting the ideology in the passage.
- **Option C** is wrong because Donghak rebellions were led by peasants and lower classes, not declining *yangban*, and major uprisings occurred in Jeolla Province, not Pyeongan.
- **Option D** is inaccurate; the Donghak Peasant Revolution began in **Gobu** (Jeolla Province), not Danseong, and did not center on Jinju.

The sequence provided is:  
1. 수출액 100억 달러를 돌파하다 (exports reaching $10 billion) – occurred in **1977**.  
2. 제2차 석유파동으로 경제가 침체에 빠지다 (second oil crisis causing economic downturn) – happened in **1979**.  
3. (가) – must be an event **after 1979** but **before** joining the OECD.  
4. 경제 협력 개발 기구(OECD)에 가입하다 – South Korea joined the OECD in **1996**.  

- **Option A**: 제3차 경제개발 5개년 계획 (Third 5-Year Plan) ran from **1972–1976**, which is *before* 1977 (first event), so it cannot fit after 1979.  
- **Option B**: 저금리, 저유가, 저달러의 3저 호황 (3-low boom) occurred in the **mid-1980s** (e.g., 1986–1988), aligning with the period after the 1979 oil crisis and before 1996. This matches the timeline.  
- **Option C**: 베트남 파병 및 브라운 각서 (Vietnam dispatch/Brown Memorandum) happened in the **1960s–1970s**, far too early.  
- **Option D**: 한일 기본 조약 (Korea-Japan Treaty) was signed in **1965**, also too early.  

Thus, **B** is the only event that chronologically fits between 1979 and 1996.

In South Korea, standard office hours typically run from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM with a lunch break. The most common lunch period for government offices and companies begins at **12:00 PM** (noon) and often lasts until about 1:00 PM. While some workplaces may have slight variations, 12 PM is widely recognized as the standard start time for lunch breaks across many organizations in Korea.

The question asks which statement about social fundamental rights is incorrect. In Korean constitutional law, social rights (e.g., the right to a human-worthy life under Article 32) are generally not directly enforceable but require legislative implementation.  

- **Option A** aligns with Constitutional Court precedent (e.g., Decision 2005HeonKa1) that excluding specific groups (like graduate students) from conditional deferment does not violate the minimum duty to ensure a human-worthy life. This is a correct description.  
- **Option B** reflects the Court’s ruling (e.g., Decision 2010HeonBa34) that setting a minimum consolation payment for mine victims (up to 20 million won) does not infringe on the right to a human-worthy life. This is correct.  
- **Option C** claims that excluding children over 19 without disabilities from survivor benefits unconstitutionally infringes on property rights. However, the Constitutional Court (e.g., Decision 2007HeonKa1) held such exclusions fall within legislative discretion and do *not* violate core rights. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.  
- **Option D** correctly states that industrial accident compensation rights are statutory creations, not direct positive claim rights against the state, consistent with jurisprudence.  

The only erroneous description is **C**.

The passage discusses how time pressure can lead to intense focus on a single task, but emphasizes that relying solely on this for efficiency is foolish because it causes neglect of other important aspects. It provides an example of firefighters skipping safety measures (like seatbelts) due to urgency, highlighting negative consequences. While options A and B describe initial beliefs mentioned, the core message warns about the dangers of narrowed focus under time constraints. Option D directly captures this central theme of negative impacts from limited vision.

The passage discusses how relying solely on efficiency under time pressure leads to focusing only on one task while neglecting other important aspects. The key point is that when rushed, people concentrate narrowly on a single goal (like firefighters prioritizing rescue over safety measures) and ignore other critical details. The blank requires a phrase that describes this narrow, exclusive focus. Among the choices, option D (""전적으로 하나에만 매달리는"") directly matches this idea of devoting oneself entirely to one thing, which aligns with the context's warning about the danger of such behavior. Other options either describe haste (A), procrastination (B), or broadening focus (C), which contradict the passage's message.

The question asks which statement about *pyeong-sijo* (standard sijo) in the Joseon period is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes the structural form of sijo as ""4음보 3행시"" (four segments, three lines), which aligns with the traditional sijo format.  
- **Option B** accurately states that the fourth segment of the last line (*종장*) uses a declarative ending (*평서형 어미*) to create resonance (*여운*), a known characteristic of sijo composition.  
- **Option D** lists valid authors like Yun Seondo and Kim Cheontaek, who are historically recognized sijo poets.  
- **Option C** claims there are two singing methods: *가곡창* (song chant) and *시조창* (sijo chant). However, *pyeong-sijo* is traditionally **recited**, not sung. *가곡창* refers to adaptations in *gagok* (court songs), which are distinct from the standard *pyeong-sijo* form. Thus, this statement is inaccurate.

The question asks for the folk game associated with both a legend about King Gongmin's crossing of Soyachen Naru (소야천 나루 건너기) and being a women's game.  
- **Option A (놋다리밟기)** involves stepping on bronze legs but lacks a direct link to King Gongmin's legend.  
- **Option B (쇠머리대기)** is traditionally played by women and originates from a legend where women balanced with iron rods to help King Gongmin (or his queen) cross the narrow Soyachen bridge. This matches both conditions.  
- **Option C (강강술래)** is a women's circle dance but unrelated to the Soyachen crossing legend.  
- **Option D (용마놀이)** involves dragon dances and has no connection to the specified legend.  

Thus, B is the only choice satisfying both criteria.

- Option A is incorrect because Baejae School (established 1885) was one of the earliest modern private schools, but it was a secondary (middle/high school-level) institution, not the first private *higher* education institution.  
- Option B is incorrect; Wonsanhaksa was not the first modern public educational institution. The first modern public schools, such as those established after the Gabo Reforms, predate or supersede this claim.  
- Option C is correct. The Gabo Reforms (1894) introduced sweeping modernizations, including the establishment of a formal modern education system with new schools and policies, marking the foundation of Korea’s modern education framework.  
- Option D is incorrect because Yukyoung Gongwon (established 1883) was founded by the Korean government as a public institution to teach Western sciences, not by American missionaries (who founded schools like Baejae or Ewha).

Statement ㄱ is correct because *Joseon Wangjo Sillok* is indeed a chronological historical record organized by year, month, and day (편년체). Statement ㄴ is also correct as the compilation process involved three stages: 초초 (rough draft), 중초 (intermediate draft), and 정초 (final draft). Statement ㄷ is incorrect because the 실록청 (compiling committee) was established *after* a king’s death, not upon ascension. Statement ㄹ is incorrect because the annals include broader events (e.g., astronomical, social), not *only* political facts, and while they cover up to the 25th ruler, the description is inaccurate due to the ""정치적 사실만"" limitation.

The question asks which historical figure is incorrectly matched with their achievements.  
- **Option A**: 문익점 is known for introducing cotton seeds to Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, which matches.  
- **Option B**: 최무선 is famous for advancing gunpowder technology and developing firearms like the *hwacha*, which aligns with the description.  
- **Option C**: 이제마 is renowned as a physician who compiled *Tongui Bogam* (동의보감), a foundational text of Korean medicine. *Nongsa Jikseol* (농사직설) is an agricultural manual authored by **Park Se-dang** (박세당) in the 19th century, not Lee Je-ma. Thus, this pairing is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: 장영실 invented scientific instruments like the *jagyeokru* (water clock) and *angbuilgu* (celestial globe), which is accurate.

The question asks which statement about the Korean modern literary group '구인회' (Guinhoe) is correct.  
- **Option A** is incorrect because Guinhoe was active in the 1930s during the Japanese colonial period, not the 1960s.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because the notable members were 이광수 (Lee Kwang-su), 박태원 (Park Tae-won), and 이태준 (Lee Tae-jun), not 이상 (Lee Sang), who was not part of the group and died before its formation.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because Guinhoe opposed class-based (proletarian) literature; it was a nationalist literary group, while 카프 (Kaphe) led the class struggle movement.  
- **Option D** is correct because Guinhoe maintained its original members without replacements from its founding in 1933 until its dissolution.

The question asks which sentence includes a hedge expression (울타리 표현) to avoid violating the politeness hierarchy (질의 격률 위배). In Korean, when making potentially disrespectful remarks about someone of higher status (e.g., a teacher), speakers use hedging phrases to soften the statement and maintain politeness. 

- **Option A** prefaces a comment about a teacher (""선생님은 어린아이 같은 면이 있으셔"") with ""표현이 적절한지 잘 모르겠지만,"" which directly hedges the speaker's judgment to avoid disrespecting a higher-status individual. This aligns with avoiding 질의 격률 위배.
- **Option B** hedges about relevance (""직접 관련이 있는지는 잘 모르겠는데"") but does not address hierarchy violation.
- **Option C** hedges about observation accuracy (""제가 잘못 보았을 수도 있지만"") regarding a peer (철수), not a higher-status person, so it doesn’t relate to politeness hierarchy.
- **Option D** questions the need to say more (""더 말할 필요가 있을까 싶지만""), focusing on relationship closeness rather than hierarchical respect.

Only **Option A** uses a hedge specifically to mitigate disrespect toward a higher-status subject (선생님).

The question asks which statement about traditional Korean rites of passage is incorrect.  
- Option A describes postpartum customs where outsiders are restricted due to the baby's vulnerability (""왼새끼""), which aligns with traditional practices (e.g., *samchil* period). This seems correct.  
- Option B claims the Joseon-era yangban coming-of-age ceremony is called ""진새례."" However, the correct term for this rite is *관례* (Gwanrye) for males and *성례* (Seongrye) for females. ""진새례"" is not a standard term, making this statement inaccurate.  
- Option C correctly identifies ""초행"" as the groom visiting the bride’s home for wedding ceremonies.  
- Option D correctly defines ancestral rites during holidays as *차례*.  

Thus, the incorrect statement is **B**.

The question asks which statement about 흘림기둥 (tapered columns) is incorrect.  
- Option A is plausible, as 흘림기둥 examples exist from the Goryeo period (e.g., 부석사 무량수전).  
- Option B correctly defines 흘림기둥 as columns with differing top and bottom diameters.  
- Option D lists actual historical buildings known to feature 흘림기둥, making it correct.  
- Option C claims division into 배흘림기둥 (pear-shaped) and 민흘림기둥. However, standard classifications are 배흘림 (tapered downward) and 역배흘림 (tapered upward), not 민흘림. ""민흘림"" is not a recognized category, making this statement inaccurate.  

Thus, C is the incorrect description.

- Option A is correct: ""딤채"" and ""짐채"" were historical terms for early forms of kimchi.  
- Option B is correct: Kimchi primarily uses vegetables (e.g., cabbage, radish) as main ingredients.  
- Option C is incorrect: Red pepper powder (고춧가루) was not used in the Silla period (57 BCE–935 CE). It was introduced to Korea much later, around the 16th century, after the Age of Exploration. Silla-era kimchi used salt and other seasonings, not red pepper.  
- Option D is correct: The Goryeo-era document ≪동국이상국집≫ (compiled in the 13th century) contains records related to kimchi-like fermented foods.  

Thus, the false statement is C.

The quote describes a proposal for selecting talented individuals through recommendations by local and central officials, followed by policy-based examinations. This aligns with the reforms advocated by Jo Gwang-jo (조광조), a prominent scholar-official during the reign of King Jungjong of Joseon. Jo Gwang-jo submitted the *Jo's Memorial* (조의제문), emphasizing merit-based appointments and virtuous conduct through collective recommendations. Historically, Jo Gwang-jo was executed in the **Gimyo Sahwa** (기묘사화, 1519), a political purge led by conservative factions opposed to his reforms. 

- **Option A** correctly states that the figure was suppressed in the Gimyo Sahwa, which matches Jo Gwang-jo’s fate.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because Jo Gwang-jo *submitted* the memorial; it was not his action to include it in ""사초"" (a historical draft), as such records were compiled posthumously by historians.  
- **Option C** and **D** are unrelated to Jo Gwang-jo’s actions or era (Queen Munjeong’s regency and Queen Yun’s deposition occurred later or involved different figures).  

Thus, the only accurate description is **A**.

- **Option B** is correct: He implemented the *gyunyeokbeop* (균역법), allowing substitutes for military service to reduce the burden on peasants.  
- **Option C** is correct: Yeongjo did not formally recognize *sanrim* (mountain-dwelling scholars) and took actions to dismantle or control *seowon* (Confucian academies) that fostered factionalism.  
- **Option D** is **incorrect**: Yeongjo pursued a *tangpyeong* (harmony) policy to avoid taking sides between factions. He explicitly **did not** actively determine which faction's claims were right or wrong, as this would exacerbate partisan conflict.

This time constraint is a standard rule. Option A (no transfer limit) is incorrect because transfers are time-bound. Option B (must use immediately) is too strict and inaccurate. Option C (up to 1 transfer) is not universally true, as some routes allow more than one transfer within the time limit.

The sequence describes events in chronological order during the Three Kingdoms period. The first event refers to Baekje moving its capital to Ungjin after losing Hanseong to Goguryeo (around 18 CE). The next event (가) must be a Silla-specific event occurring before King Seong of Baekje moved the capital to Sabi in 538 CE. 

- Choice A (Conquering Daegaya) occurred around 562 CE, after 538 CE, so it is too late.

- Choice D (Ichardon’s martyrdom leading to Buddhism’s official recognition) happened in 527–528 CE, fitting the timeline between the Ungjin move and 538 CE. This is a well-known Silla event.  

Thus, D is the correct choice for (가).

The petition emphasizes prioritizing Confucianism (for state governance) over Buddhism (for personal cultivation), reflecting a historical debate during the Goryeo Dynasty. This specific argument is attributed to Han An-in, who submitted it to **King Yejong** (reigned 1105–1122). Among the choices, the **Gyeongjeon Shigwa** policy—granting farmland (전지) and firewood land (시지) to farmers—was a key reform enacted by Yejong to stabilize agriculture and strengthen state finances. The other options relate to different kings:  
- **A** (Sangpyeongchang) was established under **Sukjong** (1095–1105).  
- **B** (Gyunyeo’s appointment) occurred later, under **Injong**.  
- **C** (7재 in Gukjagam) aligns with **Seongjong**’s earlier educational reforms.  

Thus, the event matching Yejong’s era is **D**.

The context defines ""인과"" (cause-and-effect) as a method where the cause of a phenomenon is presented first, followed by its resulting consequences. We need to identify which option clearly shows a cause leading directly to specific effects.

- **Option A** starts with the cause (온실 효과로 지구의 기온이 상승할 때) and then details the effects (해수면 상승 → 기후 변화 → 섬나라 침수). This matches the cause-and-effect structure.
- **Option B** explains a concept (제로섬) and gives an example but does not describe a clear cause-effect chain; it’s definitional.
- **Option C** describes sequential actions without emphasizing causation.
- **Option D** is purely descriptive with no causal relationship.

Thus, A is the best example.

The question asks which statement about the Sarim (士林) of the early Joseon period is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes Sarim scholars valuing reclusive life in mountain areas (산림) and their role in leading public discourse from the private sector.  
- **Option B** accurately reflects their advocacy for village autonomy (향촌 자치) and moral governance (왕도정치).  
- **Option C** is valid, as Sarim members often held positions in the Three Offices (3사) to voice opinions as public discourse (공론).  
- **Option D** contains errors: While Sarim had regional strongholds, they were primarily associated with **Yeongnam** (경상 region), not **Giho** (which refers to Gyeonggi/Honam areas). Additionally, Sarim were part of the yangban aristocracy with **larger**, not ""middle-to-small"" (중소지주), landowning backgrounds. This misrepresentation makes D incorrect.

The question asks which option is **not** a 민족 말살 정책 (ethnic annihilation policy) implemented by the Governor-General of Korea after the Sino-Japanese War. Ethnic annihilation policies during Japanese colonial rule focused on eradicating Korean cultural and national identity through forced assimilation, such as promoting Japanese ideology, language, and customs.

- **Option A**: Forcing morning palace worship (궁성요배) was part of Shinto shrine worship policies to enforce loyalty to the Japanese Emperor, directly targeting Korean identity.
- **Option B**: Memorizing the ""황국 신민 서사"" (Imperial Subjects' Oath) was a well-documented assimilation policy to instill loyalty to Japan, especially intensified after 1937.
- **Option D**: Renaming elementary schools to ""국민학교"" (national schools) in 1938 was a clear effort to strengthen Japanese imperial ideology in education.
- **Option C**: The ""남면북양 정책"" (Southern Development Policy) is **not** a real historical policy. Japan did exploit Korea’s resources, but this specific term is inaccurate. Policies like industrial resource acquisition were economic exploitation, not direct ethnic annihilation measures. This option is likely fabricated or misstated, making it the correct choice for ""not a 민족 말살 정책.""

Thus, C is the only option that does not align with documented ethnic annihilation policies.

Meanwhile, the **의료급여 제도** (Medical Aid System) specifically covers medical costs for those who qualify, including recipients of the National Basic Livelihood Security. Thus, living expenses are covered by the former, and medical expenses by the latter. Option A incorrectly attributes both supports to the National Basic Livelihood System alone, while Option C correctly separates the two supports.

- **Option C** claims 윤달 is considered *auspicious* for events like moving graves or houses. However, in Korean tradition, 윤달 is generally regarded as **unlucky**, and such activities are typically avoided during this month. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.

The passage explains that despite jellyfish being mostly water (95%) and thus low in calories, they are actually a food source for many animals like birds, penguins, and snake eels. This is because they contain nutrients such as vitamins and collagen, and they are abundant and easy to catch since they do not escape. The key point is that jellyfish *are* eaten by various animals, contradicting the earlier belief that almost no animals consume them. Among the choices, only **C** accurately reflects this main idea.

- Option B (""진땀을 흘려"" – breaking into a cold sweat) fits perfectly as it describes nervousness or fear when lost.  
- Option C (""발목을 잡아"" – grabbing the ankle) is nonsensical in this context.

The context describes a system where patients pay different amounts for medicine depending on the hospital size. Specifically, when treated for minor illnesses (like colds) at a general hospital (종합병원), the cost of medicine is higher compared to getting the same medicine via a prescription from a local clinic (동네 의원). The goal is to reduce the trend of patients exclusively choosing general hospitals due to trust. The blank should describe the mechanism that makes medicine more expensive at general hospitals. 

Choice A (""환자가 약값을 조금 더 내게"") directly matches this: it indicates patients pay slightly more for medicine when using general hospitals for minor issues. This creates a financial incentive to use local clinics, aligning with the described outcome (lower medicine costs at clinics) and the system's purpose. 

Other choices do not fit:  
- B focuses on price comparison, which is not mentioned.  
- C discusses hospitals being unable to raise fees, which contradicts the context (fees are higher at general hospitals).  
- D suggests hospitals subsidize fees, which would lower costs, but the context states general hospitals have higher costs for patients.

It also emphasizes that he actively worked to replace Chinese character or foreign names with Korean native terms (고유어), such as ""떠들썩 팔랑나비"". 

- Option A is incorrect because he reduced the count from 844 to 248, not classified as 844.
- Option B matches the context: he led efforts to use 고유어 for butterfly names.
- Option C is wrong; he used the cabbage white butterfly study to prove existing classifications were flawed, not that his own research had problems.

인천 차이나타운(중국인 거리)은 한국 인천에 위치한 중국인 이민자들이 설립한 지역으로, **중국 고유의 문화와 풍습**을 보존하고 있습니다. ""차이나타운""(Chinatown)은 전 세계적으로 중국계 이민자들이 자신들의 전통 문화와 생활 방식을 간직한 지역을 지칭합니다. 따라서 일본, 미국, 한국 고유의 문화와는 무관하며, 중국 문화가 정답입니다. 선택지 중 ""일본 고유의 문화와 풍습""이 C로 표기되었으나, 이는 명백한 오류입니다. 그러나 제공된 선택지에 따라 정확한 내용과 일치하는 옵션은 **C**가 아닙니다. 오타나 오류가 없다고 가정할 때, 중국을 가리키는 용어가 없지만, ""화교""(중국인 이민자)를 의미하는 **A: 화교 고유의 문화와 풍습**이 정답입니다. 하지만 선택지 분석 시 **C: 일본 고유의 문화와 풍습**은 완전히 잘못되었습니다. 문제의 정확한 맥락에서 인천 차이나타운은 **중국**과 관련되므로, **A**가 올바릅니다. 그러나 주어진 선택지와 실제 지식 간 불일치가 있을 수 있으나, 논리적 추론으로 **중국**에 해당하는 옵션은 **A**입니다.  

(단, 문제 설명 상 ""차이나타운""은 중국을 의미하므로, **A**가 정답임이 명확합니다.)

The question asks why many people commute daily between Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. The primary reason for such commuting is directly related to daily activities like employment and education. While proximity (Option B) and economic activity (Option C) are contributing factors, they are enabling conditions rather than the core purpose. The most direct and fundamental reason is that people travel for work, study, and similar necessities, which encompasses the essential motivation for daily commutes.

The tradition of placing a pig's head on the 고사상 (exam offering table) in Korean culture is rooted in symbolic meaning. Pigs are known for having many offspring, which historically symbolized fertility, abundance, and prosperity. In the context of exams (especially the old civil service exams), this was extended to represent wishes for success, wealth, and achieving many goals. Among the choices, option B directly references this belief about pigs having many offspring leading to the hope for earning much money or success. The other options either misrepresent the cultural symbolism (A, C, D) or lack specific ties to the traditional reasoning.

The question asks which statement about limitations on fundamental rights is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** refers to lawful police actions based on legal grounds, which aligns with constitutional principles (e.g., Article 12 of the Korean Constitution). This is likely correct.  
- **Option B** discusses aggravated punishment for drunk driving without time limits on prior offenses. The Korean Constitutional Court has ruled such provisions unconstitutional for being disproportionate (e.g., 2007헌마1096). This statement correctly identifies the excessiveness, so it is valid.  
- **Option C** claims that including ""places outside roads"" in drunk driving laws violates the clarity principle (*nullum crimen sine lege*). However, Korean courts have consistently upheld that such definitions are clear enough for ordinary people to understand (e.g., based on public safety context). Thus, this statement is **incorrect** because it misrepresents the constitutionality.  
- **Option D** states that automatic license cancellation for breathalyzer refusal does not excessively restrict rights. The Constitutional Court has affirmed such measures as justified for public welfare (e.g., 2010헌마1132), making this correct.  

The only **incorrect** explanation is **C**.

Sohee chases after Bonhee, repeatedly asking ""언니야, 올 거지?"" (Are you coming back?), showing deep worry and fear of abandonment. This reflects anxiety (불안하다) rather than satisfaction, disappointment, or being moved. The context emphasizes her clinging to the phone waiting for a message, further indicating unease.

The question describes a constitution that concentrated legislative, judicial, and executive powers under a single ruler through emergency measures, suppressing human rights. This clearly refers to the **Yushin Constitution (유신헌법)** enacted by Park Chung-hee in 1972, which enabled authoritarian rule. Among the choices, the **Busan-Masan Democratic Uprising (부마 민주 항쟁)** occurred in 1979 during the Yushin era as a major pro-democracy protest against this oppressive regime. Other options are unrelated: B refers to an earlier education policy, C (7·4 Statement) preceded Yushin (July 1972 vs. Yushin in October 1972), and D (6·3 protests) relates to the 1960 Korea-Japan Treaty under Syngman Rhee.

The passage describes a significant meeting grounded in the will of 20 million people, aiming to solidify national unity, establish fundamental policies for liberation (광복 대업), and create a unified organization to complete independence. This aligns with the historical context of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (대한민국 임시정부) in 1919, following the March 1st Movement. During this founding phase, the **""대한민국 건국 강령""** (Founding Guidelines of the Republic of Korea) was proposed to outline core principles for nation-building and independence efforts. 

Option B is incorrect because Park Eun-sik served as Prime Minister, not President, and his election occurred later. Option C is unrelated, as the Joseon Revolutionary Party was not central to this specific meeting. Option D is inaccurate because the meeting established the Provisional Government itself, not a replacement for it.

The question asks which statement about the basic principles of the South Korean Constitution is incorrect.  
- Option A correctly describes constitutional principles as foundational guidelines for legislation, policy, and respect by citizens and state organs.  
- Option B accurately states that these principles serve as interpretative standards for basic rights and constitutional review.  
- Option C claims that concepts like basic human rights, legal bounds on state power, and separation of powers are collectively reflected as the ""rule of law principle"" (법치주의 원리). However, in the Korean Constitution, these are distinct principles: basic human rights (기본적 인권) and separation of powers (권력분립) are separate foundational elements, not subsumed under 법치주의 원리 alone. This misrepresentation makes C incorrect.  
- Option D correctly reflects that National Assembly members can file constitutional complaints for violations of constitutional principles (e.g., illegal bill handling) without needing to prove specific basic rights infringement, as it pertains to their parliamentary status.  

Thus, C is the inaccurate statement.

- Option C is correct: Neungsan-ri Tomb Group (Gaya Tumuli) includes stepped stone-chamber tombs.

Gangwon Province in South Korea is predominantly mountainous, with the Taebaek Mountains running through it. This rugged terrain historically created significant challenges for infrastructure development. The steep slopes and valleys make road and railway construction difficult, leading to limited and often hazardous transportation routes. While farming and commerce can also be affected, the most direct and commonly cited issue due to the topography is the difficulty in movement and travel.

Historically, Korea was predominantly agricultural for most of the early to mid-20th century, especially before rapid industrialization in the 1960s–1970s. While manufacturing grew significantly later, agriculture remained the foundational and dominant sector for much of the century, particularly during the first half and even into the post-war recovery period. IT and service industries became prominent only toward the very end of the century.

In Korean society, rural areas typically have smaller, more stable populations where people know each other well and engage in community activities, leading to closer relationships. Urban areas, especially large cities, have higher population density and more transient residents, which often results in less personal interaction among neighbors. Therefore, rural areas are more likely to have intimate resident relationships.

The question asks which phenomenon did **not** start occurring in South Korea during the 2010s.  

- **Option A (귀농 인구 증가)**: In the 2010s, there has been a slight trend of people moving back to rural areas due to government policies and lifestyle changes, making this a phenomenon that began in this period.  
- **Option B (농촌 인구 감소)**: Rural population decline has been a long-term trend in South Korea since industrialization, so it is not specific to the 2010s. However, it continued during this period, so it is still occurring.  
- **Option C (도시 인구 증가)**: Urban population growth has persisted for decades and remained prominent in the 2010s, so it is an ongoing phenomenon.  
- **Option D (출산율 증가)**: South Korea has faced a **continuously declining** birth rate throughout the 2010s (e.g., fertility rates dropped from ~1.22 in 2010 to ~0.92 in 2020). An *increase* in birth rate did **not** occur at any point during this period, making it the clear outlier.  

Thus, **D** is the phenomenon that did **not** start in the 2010s.

The question asks for the correct grammatical features of Korean.  
- **ㄱ** is correct because Korean frequently combines words/morphemes, causing phonological changes (e.g., sound assimilation).  
- **ㄴ** is correct as Korean uses various word formation methods, including non-concatenative processes, consonant/vowel substitutions.  
- **ㄷ** is incorrect because Korean often omits essential sentence components (e.g., subjects) when contextually clear.  
- **ㄹ** is incorrect because Korean is not a fully free-word-order language; while somewhat flexible, modifier placement (관형어) is constrained (e.g., must precede nouns).  

Thus, only **ㄱ** and **ㄴ** are correct, corresponding to choice A.

The folk song describes market activities in early Joseon, emphasizing periodic local markets where people gathered to trade. Options A, B, and D align with historical facts: markets expanded after the late 15th century (A), peddlers (보부상) sold goods at markets (B), and agricultural growth led to more local markets (D). However, option C is incorrect because although the government issued *Joseon tongbo* coins (starting in 1484 under King Seongjong), coin circulation was **not** active in the early Joseon period. Coinage failed to gain widespread use due to preference for barter and rice as currency; thus, the claim of ""active coin currency circulation"" is historically inaccurate for this era.

The given passage discusses practical guidelines for packing a hiking backpack: considering purpose/schedule, avoiding overloading, distributing weight evenly, and placing lighter items below heavier ones. When analogizing to ""learning,"" appropriate contents should align with these principles.  

- **A**, **B**, **D**, and **E** all directly correspond:  
  - **A** matches avoiding excessive burden (like weight limit).  
  - **B** aligns with not overpacking essentials (avoiding too much study load).  
  - **D** reflects arranging content balance (like heavy/light item placement).  
  - **E** directly mirrors considering goals/time (like destination/schedule).  
- **C** suggests comparing multiple study methods to find the best one. However, the passage provides specific, fixed rules (e.g., weight distribution rules) rather than encouraging method comparison. This makes **C** unrelated to the passage’s concrete guidelines.

The question asks which statement about National Assembly meeting operations is incorrect.  
- Option A claims an extraordinary session is convened by the President or at least 1/5 of members. However, the South Korean Constitution (Article 111) specifies that an extraordinary session requires a request from at least **1/4** (not 1/5) of members. Thus, A is incorrect.  
- Option B correctly states meetings are public unless a majority agrees or the Speaker deems national security necessary.  
- Option C correctly describes that bills not decided during a session are not discarded, except when the term ends.  
- Option D correctly notes regular sessions occur annually as prescribed by law.  

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is A.

The passage describes a strict, rule-based organizational process from *Yulgok Jeonseo*, characteristic of **향약 (village pact)** in Joseon Korea, which emphasized Confucian ethics (삼강오륜), mutual oversight, and community autonomy.  
- **Option A** correctly describes 향약's role in maintaining rural order and self-governance.

- **Option C** refers to mutual aid functions (e.g., 상두회 for funerals or hardships), which were part of such systems.  
- **Option D** incorrectly attributes exploitation by local elites to this organization. 향약 was designed to *prevent* such abuses by enforcing moral conduct, making this the **incorrect** description.

The goal is to incorporate all three 글감 (ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ) into the outline effectively.  
- 글감 ㄱ compares Germany (government-conducted assessments) with implications for institutional structure.  
- 글감 ㄴ describes Korea’s current system (developers conduct assessments), highlighting an institutional flaw.  
- 글감 ㄷ provides an example of distorted results due to lack of objectivity, directly tied to the problem in ㄴ.  

Option B adds *""환경 영향 평가의 객관성 부족""* (lack of objectivity) under **Ⅱ-2-가** (institutional problems). This encompasses all three 글감:  
- ㄱ contrasts with Korea’s system (supporting institutional issue).

- Option B discusses criminal prosecution limits for minor injuries, which relates to substantive criminal law, not the scope of 재판청구권.  
- Option C incorrectly includes ""the right to request treatment and protection"" (치료감호) within 재판청구권; this is a specific procedural right, not part of the constitutional guarantee of access to courts.  
- Option D correctly states that military court jurisdiction over pre-enlistment crimes (현역병의 군대 입대 전 범죄) does not violate 재판청구권, as upheld by constitutional interpretations in Korea, ensuring lawful judicial assignment without denying access to justice.

The question asks which statement about the Korean Liberation Army (한국 광복군), established by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Chongqing in 1940, is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A** is historically accurate: Lee Cheong-cheon (이청천) was appointed commander, and Lee Beom-seok (이범석) as chief of staff.  
- **Option B** is correct: At the British Army's request, some units were deployed to the India-Burma (Myanmar) front during WWII.  
- **Option C** is also correct: The Korean Liberation Army collaborated with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) for intelligence and preparation for Korea’s liberation.  
- **Option D** is **incorrect**: While the Provisional Government declared war on Japan (선전 포고) in December 1941 after the Pacific War began, it did so independently. The 조선의용군 (Korean Volunteer Army) was a separate group formed earlier and was **not** formally united with the Korean Liberation Army for this declaration. The two operated under different command structures, and there was no joint declaration of war.

However, according to South Korea's Constitution (Article 104), Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President with the consent of the National Council for the Selection of Supreme Court Justices, not through the Prime Minister or State Council process.

The question asks when one would go to a local clinic (동네 의원) compared to a university hospital (대학 병원). University hospitals handle severe, complex, or specialized medical cases requiring advanced equipment or expertise. In contrast, local clinics are designed for everyday healthcare needs.  

- **Option A** (mild symptoms) aligns with the primary role of local clinics, which handle common illnesses, initial consultations, and non-urgent care.  
- **Option B** (detailed examinations) is incorrect because such needs typically require university hospitals' advanced facilities.  
- **Option C** (vaccinations) is plausible, as clinics often provide this service, but it is a specific example rather than the broad primary purpose.  
- **Option D** (dental treatment) is incorrect because dental care is usually handled by specialized dental clinics (치과), not general local clinics.  

The most comprehensive and characteristic reason to visit a 동네 의원 is for relatively mild symptoms, making **A** the best answer.

The question describes events after the Russo-Japanese War period (though ""아관파천"" historically refers to 1895), where Seo Jae-pil and others formed a group that advocated for independence, submitted reform petitions to Emperor Gojong, and held public assemblies (만민공동회). This aligns with the activities of the **독립협회 (Independence Club)**, founded by Seo Jae-pil in 1896. The key achievement directly tied to this group was the erection of **독립문 (Independence Gate)** in 1897 near the former site of 영은문 (Yeongeunmun Gate), symbolizing Korea’s break from Qing China’s tributary system and asserting independence.

The passage describes a traditional Korean marriage custom from the *Samgukji* (Records of the Three Kingdoms), where the groom resides in a small house (서옥) built at the bride's family home after a ritualized courtship. This reflects **uxorilocal marriage** (husband living with wife's family), common in early Korean societies like Goguryeo or Silla during the Three Kingdoms period.  

- **Option A** refers to a levirate marriage (widow marrying her deceased husband’s brother) after King Gogukcheon’s death, which aligns with historical records of Goguryeo’s succession customs.  
- **Option B** discusses lineage succession between Gyeru-bu and Yeonnabu clans, consistent with Three Kingdoms societal structures.  
- **Option C** describes a court intrigue involving Queen slander, plausible in historical context.  
- **Option D** claims Kim Heumun’s daughter’s marriage involved **Chinese-style** customs. However, the described practice in the passage is distinctly *indigenous* to the Three Kingdoms period, not Chinese-influenced (which became prominent later in Goryeo or Joseon). Thus, this option **does not match** the society where the described custom existed.

Since these birds rarely migrate long distances, experts speculate they were carried there by a typhoon. The sentence emphasizes that this occurrence on the island is ""매우 보기 드문 사례"" (a very rare case). The blank should describe what is rare. Option C (""일본의 텃새가 관찰된"" - Japanese native birds being observed) directly matches the rare event described: the appearance of Japanese birds in Korea.

The sentence structure indicates a contrast: even though the marketing strategy attracts attention, if product quality fails to meet expectations, the negative outcome extends beyond just the product to harm the overall brand image. The correct conjunction should express that the result is contrary to what might be expected (i.e., not just the specific product but the entire brand suffers). ""오히려"" (D) means ""on the contrary"" or ""instead,"" which fits this contrast perfectly. Other options like ""비록"" (although) or ""과연"" (indeed) do not convey this contrasting result.

The west coast (서해안) tends to have more muddy tidal flats, and regions like Gyeonggi or Chungcheong on the west/south coasts are less known for extensive sandy beaches. Gyeongsang Province's famous beaches (e.g., Haeundae) are on the *east* coast, but choice B incorrectly specifies the *west* coast, making it invalid. Thus, the correct choice is A.

The question asks for a major event influencing the development of democratic politics in South Korea. The establishment of the Constitution (A) in 1948 laid the foundational legal framework for democratic governance. While the 6·25 War (B) impacted national stability, it did not directly drive democratic development. Japan's surrender (C) enabled independence but did not shape democratic structures. North Korea's nuclear test (D) is too recent and unrelated to early democratic foundations.

The question asks what citizens demanded in June 1987 in Korean politics. This refers to the June Democracy Movement (6월 민주화 운동), a pivotal pro-democracy uprising in South Korea. The primary demand of protesters was the direct election of the president (대통령 직선제), as the existing system under the 1980 constitution used an indirect electoral college, which was seen as undemocratic. This demand led to constitutional revisions later in 1987, establishing direct presidential elections. The other options (National Assembly direct election, local autonomy, national referendum) were not the central focus of the 1987 protests.

The question asks which autumn event in Korea requires reservations for viewing. Among the options, the night opening events (야간개장) of major palaces like 경복궁, 창덕궁, and 덕수궁 (Option A) are well-known for requiring advance reservations due to high demand, especially during autumn when special seasonal events (e.g., autumn foliage illuminations) are held. These events often sell out quickly, necessitating bookings. In contrast, festivals like the Hi Seoul Festival or Seoul Intangible Cultural Festival typically allow walk-ins for many areas, and the World Ceramic Expo is less associated with mandatory public reservations.

The question asks which statement correctly describes Goryeo's *hyeongnyul* (penal system).  
- Option A states that Goryeo primarily adopted Tang China's system but adjusted it to fit Goryeo's real conditions. Historically, Goryeo's legal codes, such as the *Goryeo Daejeon*, were indeed based on the Tang Code (*Tanglü Shuyi*) but modified to suit local governance and societal needs. This alignment with historical facts makes A plausible.  
- Option B claims a clear separation between administration and judiciary, which is inaccurate; in Goryeo (as in most pre-modern East Asian states), magistrates held both administrative and judicial roles, so no such separation existed.  
- Option C emphasizes compensation over actual punishment, but Goryeo's system, like Tang's, prioritized formal punishments (e.g., flogging, exile) over compensation, which was secondary. Thus, C is incorrect.  
- Option D lists specific punishments (*taehyeong*, *janghyeong*, *dohyeong*, *yuhyeong*), which correspond to Tang's four main penalties. However, Goryeo's system was not defined *solely* by these; it was the broader adoption and adaptation of the Tang framework that characterized it. While these punishments existed, the most accurate overarching description is provided in A.  

Thus, A is the best answer.

The question asks which statement about the middle stratum in the Goryeo period is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly identifies *nam-ban* as inner officials handling palace tasks, part of the middle class.  
- **Option B** is accurate, as lower military officers were included in this stratum.  
- **Option C** is valid, as *seo-ri* (clerks managing records in central offices) belonged to the middle class.  
- **Option D** claims *hyang-ri* had **no** path to rise to *yangban* status. However, in Goryeo, *hyang-ri* could ascend to *yangban* via civil service examinations or merit, making this statement **incorrect**.  

Thus, D is the wrong description.

The passage describes a king who directly listened to people's opinions during travels, purged corrupt officials, promoted scholars regardless of faction, and used the sign ""탕탕평평실"" with a metaphor about the moon reflecting on all rivers (symbolizing inclusive rule). These characteristics align with **King Jeongjo** of the Joseon Dynasty. He is well-known for reviving the **신문고제도** (simin-gog system), which allowed commoners to submit petitions and voice grievances directly to the throne, reflecting the described policy of incorporating public opinion into governance.  

Option A refers to military control (Geumwiyeong), associated with later kings like Gojong, not Jeongjo. Option B (northern expedition) relates to earlier kings like Yeongjo or Gyeongjong, not Jeongjo’s era. Option C (abolishing merchant privileges) is unrelated to Jeongjo’s recorded reforms. Only **D** matches the described actions.

The context explains that basketball involves frequent bouncing of the ball on the floor. If the ball's color differs too much from the floor's color, it causes burden for players and spectators. This burden refers to visual strain or discomfort from high contrast between the ball and floor. Among the choices, ""눈의 피로감을 줄이려는"" (to reduce eye fatigue) directly aligns with reducing visual burden caused by excessive color contrast. Options like making the ball visible (B) would imply high contrast, which contradicts the given reasoning. Distinguishing from uniforms (D) or aiding scoring (A) are unrelated to the floor color issue described.

The key phrase is ""성과를 내고 있음에도 ( ) 언젠가 가면이 벗겨질지도 모른다는 생각에 불안해 하는 것이다."" This means even though they achieve results, they feel anxious about their mask being removed. The blank should logically connect to self-doubt, as the syndrome stems from not believing in one's real abilities. Among the choices, D (""자신의 능력을 의심하면서"") directly aligns with doubting one's own capabilities, which matches the described anxiety and causes (e.g., lack of parental affirmation or emphasis on humility).

- **Option B (정미의병 발생)**: The Jeongmi Righteous Army Uprising occurred in 1889 (Jeongmi year), which falls *between* 1884 and 1894.

The question asks which regions besides Seoul have foreign villages (외국인 마을). In South Korea, notable foreign communities exist in specific areas. 

- Option A refers to **Ansan (Gyeonggi-do)** and **Incheon**. Ansan is well-known for its ""국경 없는 마을"" (Borderless Village), a multicultural community established for foreign residents, especially from Southeast Asia. Incheon has **차이나타운** (Chinatown), a historic foreign settlement area.
- Option B (Busan Russia Village, Daegu Vietnam Village) is inaccurate; while Busan has foreign populations, there is no widely recognized ""Russia Village,"" and Daegu lacks a notable Vietnam-dedicated village.
- Option C (Gwangju America Village, Daejeon China Village) is not verified; these cities do not have officially designated foreign villages of that nature.
- Option D (Jeju Japan Village, Ulsan Philippines Village) is partially plausible (Ulsan has Filipino communities), but Jeju does not have a recognized ""Japan Village,"" and these are less established compared to the sites in Option A.

Thus, **Option A** is the correct choice based on documented foreign settlement areas.

The question asks which institution enforces laws in Korean society. In South Korea, law enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the police (경찰) for maintaining public order and investigating crimes, and the prosecution (검찰) for handling criminal prosecutions. The National Assembly (국회) is the legislative body that makes laws, not enforces them. The government (정부) is a broad term that includes executive functions but is not specific to enforcement agencies. The Constitutional Court (헌법재판소) deals with constitutional reviews, not general law enforcement. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that includes both police and prosecution.

In South Korea's legal system, law enforcement agencies (such as the police) conduct investigations. If they determine a suspect has violated the law, they do not have the authority to directly punish or deport the individual. Instead, they must refer the case to the prosecution, which then may request a trial by submitting the case to the court. Choice B correctly describes this process of applying to the court for a trial. Choices A, C, and D involve actions outside the proper legal procedures for investigative agencies.

The question asks for the **incorrect** statement about Catholicism in the late Joseon period.  

- **Option A** refers to Jeong Yak-jeon’s exile to Heuksando during the Gihae Persecution (1801) and his involvement with fish. This is historically accurate; Jeong Yak-jeon was exiled and engaged in fishing activities in the region.  
- **Option B** states An Jeong-bok criticized Catholicism through *Cheonhakmun dap* from a Neo-Confucian perspective. This is correct; An Jeong-bok authored this text to refute Catholic doctrine.  
- **Option C** describes Yun Ji-chung (1791) refusing Confucian mourning rites for his mother. This is accurate; his rejection of traditional rituals due to Catholic faith led to persecution.  
- **Option D** claims Hwang Sa-yeong mobilized the military during the *Shinyu Persecution* for faith. This is **incorrect**. The major persecution involving Hwang Sa-yeong occurred during the **Gihae Persecution (1801)**, not *Shinyu*. Additionally, Hwang Sa-yeong attempted to send a petition to the Qing court for foreign intervention, **not** mobilizing the military. The term ""Shinyu Persecution"" is historically inaccurate in this context.

The term ""특별사법경찰관"" (special judicial police officer) in Korean law refers to individuals who are authorized by specific legal provisions to perform the duties of judicial police officers, even if they are not regular police. This role is defined under the Criminal Procedure Act, where certain officials (e.g., officers of the National Tax Service, Korea Customs Service) may exercise investigative powers under legal designation. Choice B directly matches this definition. Choices A, C, and D describe general police, prosecutors, or investigation leaders, which are incorrect.

In Korean law, special judicial police officers (특별사법경찰관) are authorized to perform police duties under specific circumstances outlined in the Special Judicial Police Act. They typically step in when regular police face limitations, particularly in specialized or professional areas requiring legal or technical expertise that general police officers may not handle directly. Options B, C, and D describe roles more aligned with prosecutors (e.g., demanding punishment, filing lawsuits, or directing investigations), which are not the primary function of special judicial police officers acting as police. The correct scenario is when police cannot directly perform duties due to the specialized nature of the task.

The question asks for the necessary document to apply for pregnancy and childbirth medical expense support in South Korea. In the national health insurance system, the key document required to verify eligibility for such support during pregnancy is the ""임신확인서"" (pregnancy confirmation certificate). This certificate, issued by a medical institution, confirms the pregnancy and is essential for processing the application. While the application form (C) is also needed, the question specifically targets the unique document tied to pregnancy verification.

- Option A refers to a ""5.10 general election"" forming the Constitutional Assembly, which relates to the 1948 establishment of South Korea’s government, not the 1960 4.19 Revolution.  
- Option B discusses land reform leading to self-sufficient farmers, which occurred in the early 1950s under Syngman Rhee, unrelated to the 1960 revolution.  
- Option C claims no discussions on North-South unification occurred after the revolution, but this is historically inaccurate and the statement is incomplete; unification talks were not a direct focus of the revolution.  
- Option D correctly states that a transitional government was established with a cabinet responsibility system and bicameral legislature, which aligns with the June 1960 constitutional reforms following the 4.19 Revolution that shifted South Korea to a parliamentary system.

It specifically states that Homo sapiens used high ""친화력"" (affinity) as a survival strategy, allowing them to form larger groups and endure threats, unlike Neanderthals who had better physical traits but did not survive. Among the choices, only D directly matches this main idea—that Homo sapiens survived due to high affinity. Options A, B, and C misrepresent or contradict the context.

The question asks which statement incorrectly describes the logical premise triggered by a linguistic element.  
- **ㄱ**: Correct. ""멈추다"" (to stop) implies an ongoing action was happening before, so the premise is valid.  
- **ㄴ**: Correct. ""또"" (again) indicates a prior occurrence, so the premise about previous lies is valid.  
- **ㄷ**: **Incorrect**. The premise ""여자 친구가 있다"" (has a girlfriend) comes from the noun phrase ""내 여자 친구"" (my girlfriend), not the adjective ""예쁘다"" (pretty). The adjective describes quality but does not *trigger* the existence premise; the subject does.  
- **ㄹ**: Correct. Proper nouns like ""독도"" inherently presuppose existence.  

Thus, the incorrect explanation is **ㄷ**.

The question requires selecting the option for [A] that satisfies **both** conditions:  
1. It must show the **educational effect on participating students**.  
2. It must propose the **lifestyle changes for local residents**.  

- **Option A** only requests resident support and mentions student effort, lacking clear educational impact or resident lifestyle changes.  
- **Option B** focuses on linking festivals and future student participation but does not explicitly describe educational benefits for students or concrete lifestyle improvements for residents.  
- **Option C** highlights solving existing problems but emphasizes resident apathy and environmental issues without addressing educational gains for students.  
- **Option D** mentions ""educational activity"" generally and resident participation increasing significance, but it does not clearly specify *how* students are educated or *what specific lifestyle changes* residents experience.  
- **Option E** explicitly states that the activity instills **pride in the village and cooperative spirit in students** (educational effect) and that **residents will actively interact and increase cultural interest in improved spaces** (lifestyle change). This directly fulfills both conditions.

The question asks which usage of the provided materials (가), (나), (다) is **inappropriate** for a school newsletter about ""reset syndrome.""  
- **Option D** claims to use (가) and (다) to state that ""youths with reset syndrome most commonly fail to form proper relationships."" However, (가) only *describes symptoms* (including unstable relationships) but does **not** provide data on which symptom is *most prevalent*. (다) only gives statistics about internet usage types (e.g., 56.4% online games), with **no information** about the distribution or frequency of specific syndrome symptoms. Thus, combining (가) and (다) cannot support a claim about ""the most common type"" of affected youths, making this usage unsupported and inappropriate.  
- Other options (A, B, C, E) correctly align with the content of the materials:  
  - A uses (가)'s symptom descriptions.  
  - B uses (나)'s emphasis on family time and self-regulation.  
  - C logically links (가)/(나) to potential social problems.

The question asks which statement correctly describes both ㉠Dongnip Uigunbu (독립의군부) and ㉡Daehan Gwangbokhoe (대한광복회). These were secret independence movement organizations formed during Japanese colonial rule. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because Dongnip Uigunbu focused on armed resistance, not specifically building a republic.
- **Option B** is incorrect as Daehan Gwangbokhoe was not organized under secret orders from Emperor Gojong; he was under Japanese control and had no direct role.
- **Option D** is inaccurate; while Park Sang-jin was involved with Dongnip Uigunbu, Daehan Gwangbokhoe was centered around figures like Kim Yong-mu, not Lim Byung-chan.
- **Option C** is correct: Both organizations were established domestically (within Korea) during the 1910s (specifically in 1919), aligning with the historical context of secret societies formed under Japanese oppression.

Choice A is incorrect because Dokdo consists of two main islands (Seodo and Dongdo) and numerous surrounding rocks, not 1 island and 89 reefs. Choice B is false; the name ""Dokdo"" (meaning ""solitary island"") appeared in historical records during the Joseon Dynasty, not from I Sabu in the Silla period. Choice D is inaccurate—while South Korea maintains a presence, it is the Coast Guard (not the Navy) that stations personnel on Dokdo for monitoring and protection.

- **C: 부여 - 서동축제** is correct; Buyeo holds the Seodong Festival, celebrating the folk tale of King Seodong.  
- **D: 태백 - 태백제** is incorrect; Taebaek is associated with festivals like the *Taebaek Tulip Festival* or *Taebaeksan Mountain Festival*, not ""태백제"" (which is not a recognized major festival).

- **Option A**: 김유정문학촌 (Kim You-jeong Literary Village) is indeed located in 춘천 (Chuncheon), Gangwon Province. This is correct.  
- **Option B**: 이효석문학관 (Lee Hyo-seok Literature Museum) is situated in 평창 (Pyeongchang), as Lee Hyo-seok was born there and the museum commemorates his legacy. This is correct.  
- **Option C**: 박경리문학공원 (Park Kyung-ni Literature Park) is located in 원주 (Wonju), honoring the author of *Toji*, who was born in Wonju. This is correct.  
- **Option D**: 황순원문학촌소나기마을 (Hwang Sun-won Literary Village ""Sonagi Village"") is **not** in 정선 (Jeongseon). Hwang Sun-won’s birthplace and the associated literary site are in 평창 (Pyeongchang), not Jeongseon. Thus, this pairing is incorrect.

The question asks for the usual (보통) period of a lease (임대차) contract under Korean law. According to Korean Civil Code Article 656, if the lease term is not explicitly agreed upon in the contract, the law presumes the lease period to be **1 year**. This is the standard legal default period referred to as the ""보통 기간"" in this context.

When his parents were unsure about the direction of east for the sunrise, Jun correctly identified it by knowing where north was, leading his parents to realize his unique talent. Option A aligns with this, as Jun immediately determined the sunrise direction (east) at the travel location. Option B is incorrect because the parents did not share this ability—they were confused and relied on Jun. Option C contradicts the text, which states Jun's studies were merely average. Option D is false because the parents were happy, not worried, after discovering his talent.

The passage emphasizes that governments are increasing support (e.g., subsidies for renewable energy, deregulation in space industries) while minimizing interference, enabling private companies to lead technological development. Specifically, it mentions that some countries relaxed regulations on satellite frequencies and space launches, allowing a private company to build a Mars-capable hotel-grade spacecraft.

The question asks for examples where (ㄱ) represents the original spatial/central meaning and (ㄴ) shows abstract/peripheral meaning. In the dialogue, (ㄱ) corresponds to the core concrete sense (e.g., physical distance or height), while (ㄴ) is an extended abstract use.  

- **Option A**: (ㄱ) ""물은 낮은 곳으로 흐른다"" uses ""낮은"" (low) in a physical, spatial sense (elevation). (ㄴ) ""관심도가 낮다"" uses ""낮다"" abstractly (level of concern). This matches the required pattern.

- **Option A (분황사 모전 석탑)**: This is the Bunhwangsa Moseon Stone Pagoda, a national treasure in Gyeongju. It was constructed during Queen Seondeok's era and features four granite lion statues at the corners of its base, aligning perfectly with the description.
- **Option B (정림사지 오층 석탑)**: Located in Gyeongju, but it is a five-story pagoda without prominent lion statues on the base.
- **Option C (월정사 팔각 구층 석탑)**: Woljeongsa Temple is in Gangwon Province, not Gyeongju, so it mismatches the location.
- **Option D (화엄사 사사자 삼층 석탑)**: Haeinsa is in Gyeongsangnam-do, not Gyeongju, disqualifying it based on location despite the ""four lions"" reference.

Only **A** satisfies all conditions: correct era, location, structure, and lion statues.

2. **활유의 방식** (active, appealing expression to boost engagement).  

Analyzing choices:  
- **Option E** clearly uses antithesis: ""버리면 해로운 쓰레기가 되지만, 모으면 소중한 자원이 되지요"" (If discarded, it becomes harmful trash; if collected, it becomes a valuable resource). This directly contrasts the two sides (pollution vs. resource recovery) mentioned in the context. It also employs an active call-to-action: ""동참하세요"" (participate), enhancing appeal.  
- Other options either lack clear antithesis (e.g., A focuses on results, not inherent duality; C/D emphasize only resource aspect) or fail to balance both aspects (e.g., B encourages discarding without contrast).

The context describes a self-Q&A where the person volunteered as a **learning assistant** in an elementary science class run by a local volunteer organization. This experience is framed as the *most rewarding*, emphasizing **helping children** and building relationships, which subsequently motivated them to study science harder. However, choice C claims this activity was done *""to acquire science knowledge""* (과학 지식을 습득하기 위해). This misrepresents the purpose: the activity was primarily **volunteer teaching**, not an effort to gain knowledge. Other options align with the context:  
- A matches the scientist aspiration.  
- B reflects sharing knowledge (inspired by Schweitzer).  
- D fits the friendly, sociable nature (hospital friends and children following them).  
- E matches the positive crisis response (hospitalization as reflective time).  
Thus, C is inappropriate because it incorrectly states the intent of the experience.

The 1980s in South Korea were marked by strong public demand for democratization, particularly due to authoritarian rule under military regimes (e.g., Chun Doo-hwan). The government suppressed opposition and failed to implement meaningful democratic reforms, leading to frequent clashes such as the Gwangju Uprising (1980) and the June Democracy Movement (1987). Choice A correctly identifies that rising citizen demands were unmet by the government. Choice B is inaccurate because the government did not actively pursue democratization policies. Choice C contradicts historical fact, as demands increased, not decreased. Choice D, while partially relevant, oversimplifies the core issue of governmental refusal to concede to democratic reforms.

- **Option C** is accurate: *haekju* (itinerant merchants) acted as intermediaries, providing lodging and finance.  
- **Option D** is incorrect: *Samhan tongbo* coins were **not** minted during Joseon. The term refers to hypothetical or unofficial coins; Joseon used *Sangpyeong tongbo* (from 1678), while *Samhan* historically relates to the Three Kingdoms period, which did not issue such coins. Thus, this statement misrepresents the currency system of the described era.

The phrase ""수리해 봐야"" in the sentence implies a conditional meaning where even if the action (repairing) is attempted, the outcome (long-term use) remains difficult. This structure conveys concession (""even if"").  
- Option A (""수리해 보니까"") indicates a reason (""because I tried repairing""), which does not match the concessive meaning.  
- Option B (""수리하는 대로"") means ""as one repairs"" or ""in the process of repairing,"" which is not concessive.  
- Option C (""수리하는 바람에"") means ""due to repairing,"" implying causation, not concession.  
- Option D (""수리한다고 해도"") correctly expresses ""even if you repair,"" matching the original meaning of concession.

The sentence ""동생이 점점 아버지를 ( )"" translates to ""The younger sibling is gradually ... the father."" The key word ""점점"" (gradually) requires a verb form indicating a progressive or increasing action. 

- Option A ""닮아 간다"" means ""is resembling more and more,"" which matches the gradual change implied by ""점점.""
- Option B ""닮기도 한다"" means ""sometimes resembles,"" which lacks the progressive aspect.
- Option C ""닮았나 보다"" is past tense with uncertainty (""seems to have resembled""), incompatible with ongoing action.
- Option D ""닮은 적이 없다"" means ""has never resembled,"" contradicting ""점점.""

Thus, A is the only choice that correctly conveys a gradual resemblance.

- B (""늘리더라도"") means ""even if"", indicating concession.
- C (""늘리는 대신"") means ""instead of"", indicating substitution.

The context explains how word meanings evolve:  
- Words like **‘소졋메쥬’** use familiar terms (*메주*) to describe new concepts (cheese).  
- **‘총각’** shifted entirely from describing a hairstyle to meaning ""unmarried man"" (*original meaning lost*).  
- **‘수세미’** retains its original botanical meaning while *adding* a new usage (factory-made scrubber).  

Option **C** claims **‘수세미’** is similar to **‘총각’** because ""a new meaning was added to the existing one."" However, **‘총각’** underwent a *complete meaning shift* (original meaning disappeared), whereas **‘수세미’** *retains* its original meaning alongside a new one. This makes them fundamentally different, so the inference is inappropriate.  

Other options align with the context:  
- **A**: Matches the ""일상 단어로 새 대상 표현"" pattern (*소졋메쥬* → *입술연지*).  
- **B/D/E**: Reflect era-specific usage (*부대찌개*, *원어기* vs. *전화기*, *양반*’s historical shift).

The question asks which option is *inappropriate* when drawing an analogy between wood joining techniques and organizational harmony. The key mappings are:  
- **""External intervention""** (nailing) corresponds to temporary, weak solutions.  
- **""Internal agreement""** (joinery) corresponds to strong, lasting cohesion through collaborative effort.  

Options A–D correctly align with the analogy:  
- A reflects (ㄱ): external methods are easy but unsustainable.  
- B reflects (ㄴ): internal agreement requires time for discussion.  
- C reflects (ㄷ): internal agreement creates strong cohesion.  
- D reflects (ㄹ): different contexts require different agreement methods.  

However, **E** misrepresents (ㅁ). The original (ㅁ) emphasizes *collective effort and craftsmanship* (""장인들의 아이디어와 땀이 배어 있는""), not individual ability enhancement. E incorrectly shifts focus to *individual members' improved abilities*, which contradicts the analogy’s emphasis on collaborative process over individual skill.

Korean is typically an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language, not SVO, so option A is incorrect. In Korean, main components like subjects and objects are often omitted when contextually clear (e.g., pro-drop), making B false. Option D is incorrect because case markers (격) in Korean are determined by grammatical function and are marked by particles (e.g., -이, -을), not by word position. Option C is accurate: adverbs (부사어) in Korean can appear in relatively flexible positions within a sentence (e.g., before or after other elements) due to the use of particles and the language’s topic-prominent structure.

The question asks which statement about Korean fricatives (마찰음) is correct.  
- Choice A claims there are 6 fricatives, but Korean has only 3 primary fricatives: ㅅ, ㅆ, and ㅎ. Affricates (ㅈ, ㅊ) are not fricatives, so A is incorrect.  
- Choice B states that 'ㅆ' is 격음 (aspirated). However, ㅆ is a 경음 (tense) consonant, not 격음 (aspirated). Thus, B is wrong.  
- Choice C correctly notes that fricatives include 치조 (alveolar, for ㅅ/ㅆ) and 후두 (glottal, for ㅎ) places of articulation. This is accurate.  
- Choice D claims fricatives involve ""지속-개방"" (sustained-release) stages. Fricatives are produced with continuous airflow (지속) only, without a release (개방) phase like stops, so D is incorrect.

The context describes two main parts:  
- **(가)** explains the definition, characteristics (e.g., classification methods, state vs. private compilation), and significance (e.g., knowledge accumulation, reflection of dynastic authority) of *유서* (classified books). It also notes historical trends, such as the shift in the 17th century when *실학* (practical learning) scholars began emphasizing knowledge reorganization, accessibility (ⓒ), and inclusion of non-Neo-Confucian ideas.  
- **(나)** focuses on how *실학* scholars across specific periods (17th–19th centuries) incorporated **a particular academic field (서학, Western learning)** into *유서*. It details period-by-period examples (이수광, 이익, 이규경) showing how they adapted Western knowledge (e.g., reclassifying it under Neo-Confucian frameworks ⓔ) while addressing challenges like criticism (ⓓ).  

Option D correctly matches this:  
- **(가)** covers *유서*’s **characteristics and significance**.  
- **(나)** illustrates **period-wise acceptance of a specific academic field (서학)** in compilation.  

Other options misrepresent the focus:

- **Option A** aligns with the text: ""편찬자가 미상인 유서가 많은데... 개인적 목적으로 유서를 활용하고자 하였기 때문이었다."" This is correct.
- **Option B** matches: ""시문 창작, 과거 시험 등 개인적 목적으로"" — Joseon compiled subject-specific *yuseo* for these purposes. Correct.
- **Option C** reflects the text: ""조선의 유서는 대체로 국가보다 개인이 소규모로 편찬하는 경우가 많았고."" Correct.
- **Option D** is directly supported: ""중국에서는... 왕조의 위엄을 과시할 수 있었다."" Correct.

The question asks which data usage plan is inappropriate for an essay on water leakage problems and solutions.  
- Option D claims using (나) and (다) to argue that attaching sensors to leakage points prevents corrosion of old pipes. However, (다) describes sensors that detect leakage by identifying vibration changes—they do **not** prevent corrosion itself. Corrosion (the cause) and leakage detection (the effect) are conflated here. The sensors only identify leaks after they occur; they do not stop pipes from corroding. Thus, this misrepresents the technology's purpose.

- **Option B** suggests adding *""생활 체육 참여가 지역 발전에 미치는 영향""* (impact of participation on regional development) to **(나) ‘Ⅲ’** (solutions). However, **(나) ‘Ⅲ’** focuses on **actionable solutions** (e.g., promotion, program development, facility expansion, policy support). Including a justification like ""impact on regional development"" here is misplaced—it belongs in **(나) ‘Ⅰ’** (necessity) to strengthen the *reason* for policy action, not in the *solutions* section. This misalignment makes it inappropriate.

- Context (나) discusses works like *Oju Yeonmun Jangjeon Sango*, which accepted the **""Seohak China origin theory""** (서학 중국 원류설) and **retained Sinocentrism** (중화 관념), failing to escape the view of China as the standard of civilization.

While poor communication (C) and perceived policy failures (A) may have contributed, the primary driver was the widespread rise in democratic awareness among citizens, including students, workers, and intellectuals.

However, options A and B address (가): A incorrectly emphasizes Gojoseon (which is more central to *Samguk Yusa*'s Dangun myth), and B’s claim about Goguryeo succession is not the primary focus of *Samguk Sagi* (it centers on Silla’s legitimacy).  

The description for (나) matches *Samguk Yusa*, written by monk Iryeon during King Chungnyeol’s reign. It is a 5-volume work blending folk tales and Buddhism. Option C states it promoted *민족적 자주의식* (national self-awareness), which aligns with its preservation of foundational myths like Dangun, strengthening Korean identity during foreign domination. Option D’s *도덕적 합리주의* (moral rationalism) better fits Neo-Confucian texts, not this Buddhist work.

The passage from Yoon Chi-ho's diary describes an incident led by 4-5 reformers (개화당) who endangered the nation, leading to severe repression by Qing China. It highlights that after this event, both court and public (조야) condemned the reformers as traitors collaborating with foreigners. This aligns with the **Gapsin Coup of 1884**, where pro-reform activists (including Kim Ok-gyun) attempted a coup with Japanese military support, occupying Gyeongbokgung Palace. However, they were quickly suppressed by Qing forces under Yuan Shikai. The aftermath saw harsh Qing intervention and widespread condemnation of the reformers as disloyal.  

Choice A refers to the Jeongdong Club, which was unrelated to this event. Choice C relates to loan negotiations, which occurred later.

The question asks which statement about treaties during Korea's Open Port period (개항기) is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A**: The 1876 Korea-Japan Treaty (조.일 통상장정) included the *방곡령* (prohibition on grain export) to prevent grain outflow. This is historically accurate.  
- **Option B**: The 1882 Korea-Qing trade agreement (조.청 수륙무역장정) allowed Qing merchants to operate in Seoul. This is correct, as it expanded trade rights inland.  
- **Option C**: The 1883 Revised Korea-Japan Treaty (개정 조.일 통상장정) is claimed to have imposed ""a certain tax rate"" on traded goods. However, **tariff rates were already fixed in the original 1876 treaty** (e.g., low ad valorem rates). The 1883 revision focused on diplomatic representation and residential districts, **not** new tax rates. Thus, this description is **incorrect**.  
- **Option D**: The 1899 Korea-Qing Treaty (한.청 통상조약) was signed between the Korean Emperor and Qing Emperor as equals. After Korea’s full independence post-1895, treaties were indeed between sovereign states, making this accurate.  

The only **incorrect** statement is **C**, as the tax rates were established earlier (1876), not in the 1883 revision.

문제는 주어진 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것을 찾는 것이다.  

- **A 선택지**: ""클라이버의 법칙은 동물의 기초 대사량이 대사 체중에 비례한다고 본다.""  
  글에 따르면 클라이버는 기초 대사량이 체중의 0.75제곱(대사 체중)에 비례한다고 결론지었고, 이를 클라이버의 법칙이라 한다. 따라서 일치한다.  

- **B 선택지**: ""어떤 개체가 체중이 늘 때 다른 변화 없이 근육량이 늘면 기초 대사량이 증가한다.""  
  글에 ""기초 대사량은 ... 근육량이 많을수록 증가한다""고 명시되어 있다. 체중 증가가 근육량 증가로만 발생하면 기초 대사량이 증가하므로 일치한다.  

- **C 선택지**: ""‘L-그래프’에서 직선의 기울기는 가로축과 세로축 두 변수의 증가율의 차이와 동일하다.""  
  글에 따르면, L-그래프의 기울기는 **두 변수의 증가율의 비율**과 관련된다. 예를 들어, 체중 증가율이 2일 때 기초 대사량 증가율이 2^0.75이면 기울기는 0.75이다. 기울기는 증가율의 **차이**가 아닌 **지수(비율)** 를 나타낸다. 글에서는 ""기초 대사량의 증가율이 작을수록 기울기도 작아진다""고 하여 비율 관계를 설명하지만, **차이**라는 표현은 사용하지 않는다. 따라서 이 선택지는 글과 일치하지 않는다.  

- **D 선택지**: ""최소 제곱법은 두 변수 간의 관계를 나타내는 최적의 직선의 기울기와 절편을 알게 해 준다.""  
  글에 ""가로축과 세로축 두 변수의 관계를 대변하는 최적의 직선의 기울기와 절편은 최소 제곱법으로 구할 수 있다""고 명시되어 있으므로 일치한다.  

- **E 선택지**: ""동물의 신체 기관인 심장과 두뇌의 크기는 몸무게나 몸의 크기에 상대 성장을 하며 발달한다.""  
  글에 ""동일 종에서의 심장, 두뇌와 같은 신체 기관의 크기도 상대 성장을 따른다""고 되어 있으므로 일치한다.  

따라서 **C**가 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는다.

The conversation in (가) shows students selecting materials based on relevance to the characteristics of 아름시장. Student 3 explicitly rejects nationwide market distribution data because it is unrelated to 아름시장’s features. Student 2 suggests including survey results about consumer inconvenience to highlight the market’s advantages. This demonstrates that the primary criterion for selection was whether the data directly contributed to presenting the specific features of 아름시장. Other options (like source credibility, duplication, media suitability, or audience level) are not discussed.

The question asks which description of the function of sections (ㄱ) to (ㅁ) is inappropriate.  
- **Option A** correctly describes (ㄱ): It highlights the presenter's changed awareness (""it was a prejudice"") to make the content feel new to the audience.  
- **Option B** fits (ㄴ): It uses the newspaper article and helper service details as concrete evidence to support the claim.  
- **Option C** claims (ㄷ) checks audience understanding via questions. However, (ㄷ) uses ""궁금하지 않으세요?"" as a rhetorical device to engage interest, not to verify comprehension. This misrepresents its function.  
- **Option D** accurately describes (ㄹ): The presenter shares personal experience (""저도 그곳에 관심이 생겨 가 보았는데"") to draw attention.  
- **Option E** correctly notes (ㅁ): It uses the Hanja idiom ""백문이 불여일견"" to persuade effectively.

문제는 (나)의 발표 후 청중의 반응 중 **부적절한 분석**을 찾는 것입니다.  
- **청자 1**: 장보기 도우미와 야금장터를 대형 매장과의 경쟁력 강화로 긍정적으로 평가함 (매출 증가 기대). → A는 이를 정확히 분석함.  
- **청자 2**: 발표의 내용 구성(연구 보고서 vs. 신문 기사)을 효과적이라 평가하고, 사고 변화 경험을 언급함. → B는 적절한 분석.  
- **청자 3**: 장보기 도우미에는 공감하지만, 야금장터의 예술가 참여는 ""단순한 볼거리""라 비판적. → C는 이를 정확히 반영함.  
- **D 선택지**: ""청자1과 청자3의 반응으로 볼 때, 야금장터를 예로 들어 아름시장의 특징을 설명한 것은 청자의 행동 변화를 유도하는 데 효과적이었다고 볼 수 있군.""  
  - **문제점**: 청자3은 야금장터에 **공감하지 않아** (""단순한 볼거리 행사에 그치지 않을까?"") 명확히 **행동 변화 유도 효과를 부정**합니다. 따라서 두 청자의 반응을 근거로 ""행동 변화 유도에 효과적""이라 단정하는 것은 부적절합니다.  
- **E 선택지**: 청자2와 청자3 모두 장보기 도우미에 공감함을 지적. 청자2는 ""인식 변화에 기여""라고 하며, 청자3은 ""쉽게 공감""이라 하여 분석이 타당함.  

따라서 **D**는 청자3의 비판적 반응을 무시하고 과도한 효과를 주장해 **부적절한 분석**입니다.

The question asks how many special cities (특별시) existed in South Korea as metropolitan autonomous entities (광역자치 단체) as of 2016. In South Korea's administrative structure, ""특별시"" refers to special cities with metropolitan status. As of 2016, there were two such entities:  
- **서울특별시** (Seoul Special City), established long before.  
- **세종특별자치시** (Sejong Special Self-Governing City), designated as a special self-governing city in **2012**.  

While other major cities like Busan or Incheon are classified as 광역시 (metropolitan cities), they are not 특별시. Thus, only two qualify under the specific term ""특별시"" in 2016.

In South Korea, early voting (사전 투표) requires voters to verify their identity and eligibility at the polling station. The essential item for this process is an official identification document that contains the resident registration number. While ""신분증"" (ID card) is a general term for identification, the specific and legally required document for voting procedures—including early voting—is the ""주민등록증"" (resident registration certificate). This document uniquely confirms voter registration details. The early voting application form (C) is not mandatory as prior application is unnecessary; voters simply present valid ID during the designated period.

The passage describes a king who, in his 2nd year, received Buddhist scriptures and monks from the Chen dynasty, and in his 5th year established temples (Chomunsa and Ilbulnasa), marking the beginning of Buddhism in Korea. This aligns with **King Sosurim of Goguryeo** (reigned 371–384), who historically accepted Buddhism in 372 AD (his 2nd year) and founded temples in 375 AD (his 5th year). Among the choices, **C** correctly identifies that Sosurim established *Taehak* (태학), a Confucian educational institution, as part of his reforms to centralize governance and promote Confucian learning.

The question asks which statement about the 1920s Manchuria independence movement is **incorrect**.

- Option B is correct: The Battle of Bongo-dong (봉오동 전투) in 1920 was a victory for united Korean independence forces against Japan.  
- Option C is correct: The 국민부 (Kungminbu) was established in 1927 as part of the ""national single-party movement"" (민족 유일당운동).  
- Option D is **incorrect**: There was no significant victory at ""동경성"" (Tokyo Castle or Donggyeongseong) by Korean-Chinese joint forces. The major battles occurred in Manchuria (e.g., Bongo-dong, Cheongsanri), not in Tokyo. ""동경성"" appears to be a factual error, as no such battle took place there during this period.

The question asks which understanding of the characters is *inappropriate* (incorrect). Analyzing each option against the context:

- **Option A**: The boat people were surprised because they initially thought the couple were relatives or friends, but later realized they were husband and wife, calling it heaven’s will. This matches the text: *“양국의 뱃사람들이 ... 서로 돌아보며 소리쳐 말했다. ‘이상하고 기이한 일이로다! 이것은 하늘의 뜻이요...’”* → **Correct understanding**.
- **Option B**: Choi Cheok refers to himself as *“멀리 다른 나라를 떠도는 사람”* when speaking to the Japanese ship crew, reflecting his displaced state after fleeing turmoil. This aligns with his journey to Annam and Japan → **Correct understanding**.
- **Option C**: Claims Choi Cheok *knew* about Ok-yeong’s poetry talent before marriage but pretended not to. However, the text explicitly states: *“최척은 애초에 자기 아내가 이리 시를 잘 읊는 줄 모르고 있던터라 놀라 감탄하였다.”* (“Choi Cheok *did not know* his wife could recite poetry so well and was surprised”). This directly contradicts option C → **Incorrect understanding**.
- **Option D**: Ok-yeong diligently cared for family members, and Choi Cheok’s wealth grew after marriage. The text confirms: *“옥영은 ... 효와 정성을 다하고 ... 최척은 결혼한 후 구하는 것이 뜻대로 되어 재산이 점차 넉넉히 불었다.”* → **Correct understanding**.
- **Option E**: Relatives celebrated the wedding, and neighbors praised Ok-yeong’s conduct. The text says: *“친척들이 축하하여온 집안에 기쁨이 넘쳤고 ... 이웃 사람들이 이를 듣고는 모두 ... 칭찬했다.”* → **Correct understanding**.

Option C is the only one that misrepresents the text.

The question asks which statement correctly describes the phonological features of the words ""저울"" (jeo-ul) and ""비열"" (bi-yeol).  
- **Option A** is incorrect because the consonants within each word have different articulation methods (e.g., 저울 has ㅈ [affricate] and ㄹ [lateral approximant]; 비열 has ㅂ [stop] and ㄹ).  
- **Option B** is incorrect because in ""저울,"" both consonants (ㅈ and ㄹ) share the same articulation position (alveolar), so they are not different.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because the first syllables' vowels (ㅓ in 저울 and ㅣ in 비열) have different tongue heights (mid vs. high).  
- **Option D** is correct because the second syllables' vowels (ㅡ in 울 and ㅕ in 열) both are unrounded, sharing the same lip shape (neutral/unrounded).

The question asks about the meaning of the statue of Lady Justice (정의의 여신상) having open eyes in Korean legal context. Traditionally, Lady Justice is depicted with a blindfold to symbolize impartiality, but this question specifically refers to the case where her eyes are *open*. In Korean legal symbolism, when the statue's eyes are open, it emphasizes that justice observes and treats all individuals equally without bias. Among the choices, option C directly aligns with this meaning: ""모든 사람을 공평하게 보겠다는 의미"" (to look at everyone equally). Options A, B, and D describe related but distinct concepts (active help, monitoring fairness, listening to opinions), which are not the primary symbolism of open eyes in this context.

The question asks which statement about the rule of law (법치주의) in Korean constitutional law is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** is correct: The Korean Constitution does not explicitly mention ""rule of law,"" but it is recognized as a fundamental principle through judicial interpretation (e.g., Constitutional Court decisions).  
- **Option B** is correct: Legal reservation (법률유보), requiring formal statutes for administrative actions, is a core element of 법치주의.  
- **Option C** is **incorrect**: While the principle of trust protection (신뢰보호) generally prohibits *disadvantageous* retroactive laws, **favorable** retroactive legislation (e.g., reducing penalties) is permitted under Korean law. The statement claims *all* legal norms only apply prospectively and that ""시혜적 소급입법"" (arbitrary retroactive legislation) is *always* prohibited, which is too absolute and misrepresents the law.  
- **Option D** is correct: Proportionality in restricting basic rights aligns with 법치주의 principles.

The question asks which statement about the local autonomy system in Korea is incorrect.  
- Option A claims that matters regarding the organization and powers of local councils and council elections are determined by *조례로* (presidential decree/ordinance). However, according to South Korea’s Constitution (Article 117) and the Local Autonomy Act, these specific matters (organization, powers, and elections of local councils) **must be prescribed by law (법률)**, not by ordinance. Thus, A is incorrect.  
- Option B correctly reflects Constitutional Court rulings that local autonomy is institutionally guaranteed but allows legislative flexibility within constitutional bounds.  
- Option C is valid, as special local autonomous entities can be established for specific purposes under the Local Autonomy Act.  
- Option D accurately describes the powers of local governments under Article 118 of the Constitution.

The question asks which reaction to passage [C] is *inappropriate* based on the given context. Passage [C] emphasizes that Gyeomjae’s paintings do **not** rely on traditional perspective (원근) to establish realism. Instead, realism arises from the *relationship between the observing human and the world*. Specifically:
- Distant objects are placed by ""depth of gaze,"" not physical distance.
- Close objects do **not** gain realism simply because they are near; distant objects are **not** deprived of realism just because they are far.
- Human-related elements (e.g., pavilions) have ""comparative clarity"" because their realism is defined by the observer’s relational perspective, **not** by perspective-based accuracy.

Now evaluating the choices:
- **A**, **B**, **C**, and **E** align with [C]’s core idea: realism is reconstructed through the artist’s gaze, not literal representation.
- **D** claims that human-related objects are drawn with clarity to place them in ""positions meaningful to the composition **in order to show perspective as it is**."" This misrepresents [C], which explicitly states that such clarity comes from the *relationship with the observer*, **not** from preserving or illustrating perspective (원근감). Thus, D contradicts [C]’s central argument.

The question asks from which war onward the United States began having significant influence over South Korea's politics. After World War II (1945), Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial rule, and the peninsula was divided along the 38th parallel. The US took control of the southern part, establishing a military government that shaped South Korea's early political structure. This marked the beginning of sustained US political influence. While the Korean War (1950-1953) deepened US involvement, the foundational influence started after WWII. The other options (WWI, Vietnam War) are not relevant to South Korea's early political formation.

The question asks which statement correctly describes the 제17관 임시토지조사국 (Temporary Land Survey Bureau under the 17th regulation), which was established during the Japanese colonial period in Korea to compile land registers and conduct land surveys. The key function was to investigate, survey, and register land details based on landowner declarations. 

- Choice A is incorrect because the bureau focused specifically on land (토지), not forest areas (임야).  
- Choice C is incorrect as it refers to tax rates (1.3%), which is unrelated to the bureau’s primary role of registration and surveying.  
- Choice D mentions certification rules, but while such rules may have existed, the core purpose of the law was the declaration and registration process, not the promulgation of those specific rules.  
- Choice B accurately reflects that the law required landowners to report details such as land grade (등급), boundaries (지적), plot numbers (결수), and land use type (지목), which aligns with the bureau’s function of compiling and confirming land records.

In 2000, South Korea was led by President Kim Dae-jung, and North Korea was led by Kim Jong-il (Kim Il-sung had died in 1994). The summit occurred in June 2000, making option B the correct pair.

The 6·15 South-North Joint Declaration (2000) focused on peaceful unification, reconciliation, and humanitarian issues. Key contents include:  
- **A**: Self-reliant resolution of unification (자주적 해결) is a core principle.  
- **B**: Discussion of unification under ""one nation, two systems"" (1국가 2체제) was explicitly mentioned as a framework for talks.  
- **C**: Resolving separated families (이산가족 문제) was a major agreed point.  
- **D**: Military alliance (군사적 동맹) was **not** part of the declaration, as it emphasized demilitarization and trust-building, not forming alliances.  

Thus, **D** is the correct choice as it was not included.

The mock negotiation shows both parties compromising: the company addresses economic benefits first, while the city prioritizes environmental concerns (supporting E). They narrow differences through gradual job increases and local sourcing agreements (supporting B and C). They cooperate competitively to reach agreements (supporting A). However, there is no mention of involving a third-party mediator when differences arise (e.g., job numbers or pricing were resolved directly between the two sides, even when the city arranges farmer talks—it’s not third-party mediation). Thus, D is not observed.

The question asks for the earliest era from which documents exist proving Dokdo (Takeshima) as Korean territory. Historical records indicate that the *Samguk Sagi* (History of the Three Kingdoms), compiled during the Goryeo Dynasty, references Silla's incorporation of Usanguk (Ulleungdo and Dokdo) in 512 CE under King Jijeung. While the *Samguk Sagi* itself is a later compilation, it documents events from the Silla period, specifically citing King Jijeung's reign as the time when Dokdo came under Korean control. No surviving documents from the Goguryeo or Baekje periods directly claim Dokdo, and though Joseon records are detailed, they are later. Thus, the earliest referenced era in historical texts is the Silla Jijeung period.

The question asks which statement correctly describes the structure of Sino-Korean compound words (한자어 합성어). In Korean linguistics, 한자어 합성어 are typically formed by combining **비자립적 어근** (non-independent roots derived from Chinese characters) that cannot stand alone as independent words in modern Korean.  

- **Option A** claims 창문 (窗門) and 차비 (車費) are 단어 + 단어 (word + word). However, 창, 문, 차, and 비 are all non-independent roots (e.g., 창 is only used in compounds like 창문 or 창고; 차 is used in 차비, 차량, etc., but not alone). Thus, this is incorrect.  
- **Option B** claims 안경 (眼鏡) and 상장 (賞狀) are 단어 + 비자립적 어근. Both 안 and 경 in 안경, and 상 and 장 in 상장, are non-independent roots. Neither component is a standalone word, so this classification is wrong.  
- **Option C** claims 우정 (友情), 대문 (大門), 군비 (軍備) are 비자립적 어근 + 단어. While 우, 대, 군, 정, 문, 비 are all non-independent, **문** in 대문 is also non-independent (e.g., 문화, 문장—not used alone). Thus, this misclassifies one component as a 단어 (word), making it incorrect.  
- **Option D** claims 노인 (老人) and 정원 (定員) are 비자립적 어근 + 비자립적 어근. **노** (老) and **인** (人) in 노인, and **정** (定) and **원** (員) in 정원, are all non-independent roots that cannot function as standalone words in Korean. This matches the standard structure of Sino-Korean compounds.  

Thus, **D** is the only correct description.

These customs align with historical records of **Goguryeo**, where sky worship was central and specific officials oversaw rituals. Choice B directly references ""천군"" (Cheongun), officials responsible for sacrifices to ""천신"" (heavenly deity), matching the October sky ritual described.

The question asks which statement about South Korea's activities for Korean unification is **incorrect**.  
- **Option A** correctly describes the 1972 ""7·4 South-North Joint Statement"", which established principles of self-reliance, peace, national unity, and denuclearization. This is historically accurate.  
- **Option B** claims that in September 1985, separated families and art troupes crossed visits between Seoul and Pyongyang. However, **no such exchange occurred in 1985**. Due to heightened tensions and political disputes (e.g., North Korea’s actions and South Korea’s domestic instability), planned family reunions were repeatedly canceled or postponed. The first actual South-North family reunions occurred much later, in the 1990s and 2000s. Thus, this statement is **factually incorrect**.  
- **Option C** refers to the December 1991 ""Agreement on Reconciliation, Non-Aggression and Exchange and Cooperation"", which was indeed signed. This is correct.  
- **Option D** correctly states that the 2000 Pyongyang South-North Summit resulted in the June 15 Joint Declaration. This is well-documented.  

Therefore, the only **incorrect** statement is **B**.

The question asks about correct descriptions of South Korea's overseas migration policies after liberation (post-1945).  
- Option A (1950s - miners to West Germany) is incorrect because the miner and nurse dispatch to West Germany began in the **1960s** (agreements signed in 1962, first arrivals in 1963), not the 1950s.  
- Option B (1960s - agricultural immigration to South America) is accurate. In the early 1960s (e.g., 1962), the South Korean government initiated organized agricultural migration to countries like Brazil as part of its emigration policy to alleviate population pressure and economic hardship.  
- Option C (1970s - nurses to Eastern Europe) is implausible, as Eastern Europe was under communist rule during the Cold War, and South Korea had minimal labor migration there due to political tensions.  
- Option D (1980s - construction workers to Vietnam) is incorrect; significant Korean labor dispatch to Vietnam occurred much later (2000s), while 1980s efforts focused on the Middle East (e.g., Saudi Arabia).  

Thus, only option B aligns with historical facts.

This aligns with the context passage, which emphasizes that reading enables self-examination (""자기 성찰의 행위"") and is a journey into one's inner self (""자기 내면으로의 여행""). Choice A directly captures this realization and the intention to practice reflective reading (""책장을 천천히 넘기며 나에게로의 여행을 떠나 보려 한다"").

The sentence ""하늘에 하얀 구름이 거북이처럼 움직인다"" uses the verb ""움직인다"", which is an intransitive verb (자리동사) that does not take a direct object. This makes it a **한 자리 서술어** (one-place predicate), as it requires only a subject argument.  
- Option A is incorrect because ""거북이처럼"" is an adverbial *phrase* (부사어구), not a 부사절 (adverbial clause).  
- Option B is wrong since ""움직인다"" is intransitive, not transitive (타동사).

The question asks which statement about the National Security Council (국무회의) in South Korea is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A** correctly describes the composition: the President, Prime Minister, and 15–30 ministers, aligning with South Korea’s Constitution and related laws.  
- **Option B** is accurate: the Constitutional Court has ruled that 국무회의 decisions are internal deliberations without direct legal effect on citizens.  
- **Option C** is **partially contentious**, but constitutional provisions do require deliberation on major policy evaluations. However, petitions are **not** explicitly mandated as *constitutional* requirements, though this is less clearly incorrect than D.  
- **Option D** is **clearly wrong**: the **President**—not the Prime Minister—presides over the 국무회의 as its chairman (의장), per Article 89 of the Constitution. The Prime Minister only presides *in the President’s absence*. Thus, stating the Prime Minister is the chair is factually incorrect.

The question asks which statement about the constitutional legislative process in Korea is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A** correctly states that after a bill is passed by the National Assembly and sent to the government, the President must promulgate it within 15 days (per Article 72 of the Constitution). This is accurate.  
- **Option B** correctly describes the President’s right to return the bill with objections within 15 days for reconsideration. This aligns with constitutional provisions.  
- **Option C** states that the President cannot demand partial reconsideration or amended versions of the bill. This is accurate, as the Constitution only allows the President to veto the *entire* bill, not parts of it.  
- **Option D** claims that if the President does not promulgate within **5 days**, the Prime Minister does so. However, the Constitution specifies a **15-day** period (not 5 days) for presidential action; if the President does not act within 15 days, the bill is automatically promulgated—there is **no role for the Prime Minister** in promulgation under this timeframe. Thus, D is factually incorrect.  

The only **incorrect** statement is **D**.

However, Article 65 of the Constitution specifies that impeachment (including of Constitutional Court judges) requires a **two-thirds majority** (3분의 2 이상), not just a simple majority (과반수). Thus, this description is **incorrect**.  
- **Option B** correctly describes the dismissal of the Prime Minister: proposal by a majority and passage by a two-thirds majority (Article 67).  
- **Option C** is correct: expulsion of a National Assembly member requires a two-thirds majority (Article 47).

The question asks which statement about the President of South Korea is incorrect.  

- **Option A** aligns with Article 65 of the Constitution, which requires presidential state acts to be documented and countersigned by the Prime Minister and relevant ministers, except for military commands. This is correct.  
- **Option B** reflects Article 70, granting presidential immunity from prosecution during term except for treason or rebellion. This is correct.  
- **Option C** matches Article 79, allowing the President to grant clemency but requiring National Assembly consent for general amnesties. This is correct.  
- **Option D** misrepresents the election process. According to the Public Official Election Act, if multiple candidates tie for the highest votes in the *first round*, a runoff is held between the top candidates. The National Assembly only intervenes if the runoff also results in a tie. The statement incorrectly claims the Assembly decides immediately when there are two or more top vote-getters in the initial election, making it inaccurate.

Trot는 한국의 전통 대중 가요 장르로, 강한 리듬과 부드럽고 정서적인 멜로디가 특징이다. 일본 엔카의 영향은 있으나, 핵심은 2/4 또는 4/4 박자에 기반한 강한 리듬과 애잔한 멜로디의 조화이다. 선택지 A는 시간적 특성만 강조하고 일본 엔카에 초점을 맞추나, 정확한 주요 특징은 아니다. 선택지 C와 D는 장르의 본질과 무관하다.

- Option A is incorrect because the voting age was lowered from 20 to 18 (not 19) through constitutional amendment in 2018, not due to a constitutional court decision.
- Option B is wrong because while National Assembly elections use proportional representation, local council elections primarily use single-member district systems, not proportional representation for most seats.
- Option C is false because the minimum age for presidential eligibility is 40, not 25 (though 25 is correct for National Assembly candidates).
- Option D is correct: For proportional representation in local council elections, parties must receive at least 3% of valid votes to qualify for seat allocation, as stipulated by South Korea’s election laws.

The question asks what historically constituted a large portion of Korean popular culture. In the past (particularly from the 1960s to the 1980s), South Korea's domestic cultural industries were less developed, and there was significant reliance on imported content due to Western influence (especially from the U.S. and Hong Kong) following the Korean War. American movies, Hong Kong dramas, and songs were widely consumed, whereas traditional forms like music, dance, or art remained more niche and culturally preserved rather than dominant in mainstream popular culture.

Option A correctly reflects Article 117 of the South Korean Constitution, which states that the establishment, abolition, division, or merger of local government entities must be determined by law. This is a fundamental principle of local autonomy in Korea.  

Option B is incorrect because while residents have recall rights over local government heads, this does not extend to council members (both regional and proportional representation).  

Option C is incorrect; the Board of Audit and Inspection (감사원) is legally authorized to audit both delegated affairs (위임사무) and autonomous affairs (자치사무) for legality, and precedents support that such audits do not inherently violate local autonomy rights.  

Option D is incorrect because if a local government head runs for re-election, they typically retain their position until the election results are officially confirmed (not just until election day), and specific regulations may require temporary suspension of duties during campaigns.

The context explains the process of creating a bird's-eye view image using multiple cameras. It describes lens distortion where the image is convex in the center and increasingly curved away from the center. This distortion, caused by the lens's curvature, can be corrected by establishing a distortion model **if the distortion coefficients (internal parameters) are known**. Choice D accurately reflects this: ""영상이 중심부로부터 멀수록 크게 휘는 것은 왜곡 모델을 설정하여 보정할 수 있다."" (Images curving more away from the center can be corrected by setting a distortion model).  

Other choices are incorrect:  
- **A** is wrong because the 360° view uses multiple cameras (front, rear, sides), not one.  
- **B** misrepresents external variables—they are corrected by comparing captured images to real-world grids, not by knowing camera features (which relate to internal variables).  
- **C** reverses the process: distortion correction happens *before* compositing individual camera feeds.  
- **E** is false because the final bird's-eye view is a 2D representation, not 3D coordinates.

This usage is **physical movement through a tangible object** (light traversing the lens material). Among the choices, we must find the sentence where the verb ""지나다"" is used in a **similar physical, spatial sense** rather than abstract or metaphorical.

The poem (나) by 김관식 describes the mountain as an eternal, unchanging entity (""태고로부터 푸르러 온 산""), contrasting it with ever-changing humans. It emphasizes the mountain's calmness, humility, and role as a lifelong companion and spiritual homeland. The speaker views the mountain as a source of enduring wisdom, a connector of life and death (""이승의 낮과 저승의 밤에 뻗쳐 있어""), and an object of deep longing (""네 품이 내 고향인 그리운 산""). 

- **Option A** aligns with the poem’s focus on the mountain’s unchanging nature vs. human variability.  
- **Option B** incorrectly suggests the mountain actively manifests human virtues. The poem portrays the mountain as passive (humble, enduring), with the *human* projecting virtues onto it, not the mountain having ""적극적 의지"" (active will).  
- **Options C, D, and E** all match the poem’s themes: the mountain links life/death, is a homeland, and is both present companion and ultimate ideal.

- **Option B** claims that ""each level of court cannot exercise this review power."" However, under Article 107(2), **all courts** (including lower courts) have the authority to review the constitutionality and legality of orders and regulations in concrete cases. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.  
- **Option C** is accurate because the Supreme Court holds the final authority in such reviews.

The key distinction lies in the usage constraints of ""-길래"" versus ""-아서/어서"".  
- In example (ㄱ), both forms work because the speaker *directly observes* that apples are expensive (""사과가 비싸길래""), which aligns with ""-길래"" requiring the speaker’s personal experience.  
- In example (ㄴ), ""-길래"" is ungrammatical because the event (Sejong creating Hangul) is a historical fact *not personally experienced* by the speaker. ""-아서/어서"" can express general causal relationships regardless of personal observation.  
Options A, B, and D are incorrect: ""-길래"" can use human subjects (A false), works with verbs (B false), and the past tense issue (D) doesn’t explain the specific ungrammaticality in (ㄴ). Only **C** correctly identifies the requirement for direct speaker experience.

- **C (앞뒤가 맞지 않아요)**: ""앞뒤"" literally refers to ""front and back,"" but here it means inconsistency in statements, a metaphorical sense.  
- **D (논밭마다)**: ""논밭"" is a compound of ""논"" (paddy field) and ""밭"" (dry field), but in this context, it is used **literally** to describe actual fields filled with green waves in summer.

The question asks which option incorrectly interprets ㉠ and ㉡.  
- **㉠** refers to the *umbrella case* partially visible from the back pocket (described as ""케이스"").  
- **㉡** is defined as *""우산 이상의 것""* (something more than an umbrella), implying recognition of the umbrella (or its case) as significant or authoritative.  

**Analysis of choices**:  
- **A**: Correct. Kim discovers people often mistake ㉠ (case) for ㉡ due to its subtle visibility.  
- **B**: Correct. The third conclusion states showing ㉠ subtly elicits stronger reactions.  
- **C**: Correct. The first conclusion mentions ""일부 극소수의 사람들"" (familiar with real lightning rods) do not fall for the trick, so his intent fails for them.  
- **D**: Correct. Kim observes that ""거개의 서민들"" (general public) unfamiliar with ㉡ mistake ㉠ for it.  
- **E**: **Incorrect**. The ""사복 차림의 청년"" completely ignores the umbrella case (""애당초 거들떠볼 생심조마 하지 않았다"") and does **not** recognize it as ㉡. The text states he fails to see it as ""우산 이상의 것,"" meaning he is *not* familiar with ㉡ in a way that reveals Kim’s intent.

The question asks which option is *inappropriate* based on the context and the critique that the work criticizes the situational logic of petit-bourgeois (소시민) who protect vested interests through power dynamics. 

- **Option E** claims that Kim Dal-chae ""cut off the bond with students to protect vested rights."" However, in the context, Kim Dal-chae had **no prior relationship or bond with the students**. He was merely a bystander who impulsively intervened out of newfound confidence from past approvals. When the plainclothes officer ignored his umbrella (fictional power symbol), he retreated not due to ""cutting a bond"" but because his fake authority was unacknowledged. The context shows no ""유대 관계"" (bond) with students; his retreat reflects helplessness, not calculated protection of vested interests. This misrepresents the narrative and the critique’s focus.

Other options (A–D) align with the context:  
- A reflects Kim’s awareness of power dynamics.  
- B shows how perceived power alters interactions.  
- C explains his appearance change to gain approval.  
- D correctly ties his sudden courage to accumulated confidence from prior approvals.

The question asks which statement about equality rights in Korean law is incorrect.  
- **Option A** correctly describes that the level of judicial scrutiny (strict or relaxed) depends on the degree of legislative discretion, aligning with Korean constitutional jurisprudence.  
- **Option B** is accurate because Article 34 of the Korean Constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination against women in all areas of life, including employment (as part of economic life).  
- **Option C** is correct as Article 11 explicitly lists sex, religion, race, and social status as prohibited grounds for discrimination.  
- **Option D** is incorrect. While ""사회적 신분"" (social status) refers to long-term, hierarchical social positions (e.g., caste-like systems), Korean constitutional courts have consistently ruled that being a convicted criminal (전과자) does **not** qualify as ""사회적 신분,"" as it is not an inherent or permanent social status.

The question asks for evidence that refutes Chinese and Russian claims about Balhae (발해) from a Korean historical perspective. China views Balhae as a subordinate local regime to the Tang Dynasty, while Russia emphasizes Central Asian/Siberian influences to incorporate it into Russian history. Korean historiography asserts Balhae as an independent Korean state with distinct cultural continuity.  

- **Option A (신라와의 교통로)**: Trade routes with Silla show interaction but do not directly prove Korean cultural identity or sovereignty against the claims.  
- **Option B (상경성 출토 온돌 장치)**: Ondol (traditional Korean underfloor heating) is a uniquely Korean cultural feature. Its discovery in Balhae's capital demonstrates strong Korean cultural influence, countering China's claim of subordination (by showing independent cultural development) and Russia's claim of Central Asian dominance (by highlighting Korean, not Siberian, roots).  
- **Option C (유학 교육 기관인 주자감)**: Confucian institutions reflect Chinese influence, which *supports* China’s narrative rather than refuting it.  
- **Option D (3성 6부의 중앙 행정 조직)**: This administrative system was modeled after Chinese structures, which China could use to argue subordination, making it weak refutation evidence.  

Thus, **B** is the strongest evidence, as it directly ties Balhae to Korean cultural heritage.

Option B is correct: Independent members (not in 교섭단체) have their committee assignments decided by the Speaker.  
Option C is valid: Committees like 정보위원회 can establish standing subcommittees.  
Option D aligns with procedure: Appointments follow proportional representation requested by party leaders, approved by the Speaker.  

Thus, A is the **incorrect** description.

The question asks which statement about Bronze Age relics and artifacts in Korea is correct.  
- Option A refers to a fist axe (주먹도끼), which is typically a Paleolithic tool, not Bronze Age. Yeoncheon Jeongok-ri is known for Paleolithic sites, so this is incorrect.  
- Option B mentions a writing brush, which is associated with later periods (e.g., Three Kingdoms), as writing did not exist in the Korean Bronze Age.  
- Option C states that table-type dolmens (탁자식 고인돌) were found in Ganghwa Bugeun-ri. Dolmens, especially table-type, are hallmark Bronze Age structures in Korea, and Ganghwa is a well-documented site for such finds.  
- Option D cites comb-pattern pottery (빗살무늬토기) from Amsa-dong, but this pottery style belongs to the Neolithic period, not the Bronze Age.  

Thus, only option C accurately describes a Bronze Age relic.

In pragmatics, conversational implicatures (함축된 것, 화자 의미) are the implied meanings beyond the literal sentence meaning and are **cancellable** without contradiction. For example, if someone says ""Some students passed the exam,"" the implicature might be that not all passed. This can be cancelled by adding ""Actually, all students passed."" In contrast, the literal meaning (말한 것, 문장 의미) represents what is explicitly stated and generally **cannot** be cancelled without contradiction. Option A is incorrect because fixed (conventional) implicatures are typically not cancellable. Option C is wrong because sentence meaning is not cancellable. Option D is incorrect because cancellation of implicatures does not require only negation and sentence meaning cannot be cancelled at all.

The notice states the festival runs from August 20 (Saturday) to August 21 (Sunday), which are two consecutive weekend days. This matches choice B.

The context states that 만화방 has reborn as a '만화카페' where people can enjoy both 볼거리 (things to see) and 먹을거리 (things to eat). It highlights that while similar to 만화방 in being a space for reading comics, 만화카페 differs with bright lighting, refined atmosphere, and coffee. It also specifies that 만화카페 is popular with women in their 10s-20s, not men. 

- Option A is incorrect because the indoor atmosphere is described as *different* (bright, refined), not similar.
- Option B contradicts the text, which says 만화카페 is popular with young women, not men.
- Option C is inaccurate; while coffee is mentioned, the core identity is being a place for both viewing and eating, not solely for coffee.
- Option D directly matches the key point: ""볼거리, 먹을커리를 함께즐길 수 있는"".

The question asks which statement about 공무담임권 (right to hold public office) is **incorrect**.  

- **Option D** defines 공무담임권 as encompassing both 피선거권 (right to be elected in elections) and 공직취임권 (right to be appointed to public office). However, under Korean constitutional law, 공무담임권 specifically refers to the **right to be appointed** to public office positions (e.g., civil servants), as protected under **Article 16** of the Constitution. In contrast, 피선거권 (the right to run for election) falls under **Article 15**, which governs electoral rights and is legally distinct. Thus, including 피선거권 within 공무담임권 is **incorrect**.  

- **Option A** claims a provision violates a local government head’s 공무담임권. While vague, local government heads (elected positions) are tied to 피선거권, not 공무담임권. However, this statement’s correctness depends on context not provided, and it is not *inherently* wrong in all cases.  
- **Option B** critiques an age limit (32) for public service exams as violating Article 37(2) (proportionality of rights restrictions). This aligns with constitutional principles and is a valid argument.  
- **Option C** accurately describes the scope of 공무담임권, including protection against unfair dismissal, suspension, or promotion barriers.  

Thus, **D** is the **incorrect** statement.

The question asks which statement about elections in Korean law is incorrect. 

- **Option A** correctly describes Article 24 of the Constitution, which uses legislative reservation for voting rights. This aligns with constitutional interpretation.
- **Option B** reflects the Public Official Election Act provisions for accessibility (e.g., braille or barcode substitution for election materials), which is accurate under current disability accommodation laws.
- **Option C** claims that a fine of 1,000,000 KRW or more for election crimes results in loss of voting rights for 5–10 years. However, Korean election law (Public Official Election Act, Article 6) specifies that **imprisonment** (not fines) for election crimes leads to voting rights restrictions. Fines alone do not disqualify voters, making this statement incorrect.
- **Option D** correctly states the residency and age requirements for presidential eligibility per Constitution Article 67.

Thus, the incorrect statement is **C**.

- Option C is correct per Article 74, which mandates prior National Assembly consent for national debt contracts.  
- Option D is correct under Article 73, granting consent power over major treaties.  
- Option B is flawed: The National Policy Audit Committee (국정조사위원회) can operate during recess, but it **does not** require requests for documents or witness summons to go through the Speaker (의장). It can directly demand these under the National Assembly Act, making the described procedure incorrect.

The question asks which statement about the crime victim relief claim right (범죄피해자구조청구권) in Korean law is correct.  

- **Option A** states that foreigners can only exercise the claim right if there is mutual reciprocity with their country. This aligns with Article 14 of the Crime Victim Compensation Act (범죄피해자보상법), which requires reciprocity for foreign victims.  
- **Option B** incorrectly includes property damage (재산상 피해). The relief system under this law applies only to physical harm or death, not property damage.  
- **Option C** wrongly claims coverage for crimes outside Korean territory. The law only covers crimes occurring within South Korea’s territory.  
- **Option D** misstates the time limits. The correct period is 3 years from when the victim became aware of the damage, but the absolute deadline is 10 years from the crime occurrence, not 5 years.  

Thus, only **A** is accurate.

The question asks which statement about Korean morphological features is incorrect.  
- Option A correctly describes Korean as an agglutinative language with developed particles (조사) and verb endings (어미).  
- Option B is accurate because Korean has more derivational suffixes than prefixes.  
- Option C is valid as some reduplicative compounds (e.g., ""밤밤"") ignore vowel harmony rules.  
- Option D is incorrect because particles (조사), while having allomorphic forms (이형태), **can be omitted** in casual speech (e.g., dropping subject/object particles in spoken Korean). Thus, claiming they are ""생략이 불가능하다"" (cannot be omitted) is false.  

### ANSWER

The question asks which statement about Korean syntactic features is incorrect.  
- Option A is correct because Korean allows topic markers (은/는) which can appear with subjects or objects (주격/목적격 중출문).  
- Option B is correct as Korean follows a basic SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order.  
- Option C is correct since honorification (주체 높임) is expressed through particles (조사) and verb endings (어미).  
- Option D is incorrect because in Korean, modifiers (관형어, such as adjectives or relative clauses) must precede the noun they modify; their position is not freely changeable.  

Thus, D is the statement that is not true.

  파생 접미사는 의미가 비교적 고정되어 있으나, 어미도 각각 특정 문법적 기능(예: 시제, 호응, 연결)을 지니며 의미가 일정하다. 따라서 이 설명은 정확하지 않다.  

- **선택지 B**: ""파생 접미사는 단어 형성에 참여하지만, 어미는 단어 형성에 참여하지 않는다.""  
  파생 접미사는 새로운 단어 형성을 위해 어근에 붙지만(예: 사랑 + 하다), 어미는 단어의 변형(시제, 법 등)을 담당할 뿐 단어 형성에 관여하지 않는다. 이 설명은 맞다.  

- **선택지 C**: ""파생 접미사는 어근에 결합할 때 제약이 심하지만, 어미는 제약이 심하지 않다.""  
  파생 접미사는 어근의 음운적 조건(자음/모음 종성)에 따라 결합이 제한되지만, 어미도 이우열 등의 제약이 존재한다. 그러나 일반적으로 파생 접미사의 결합 제약이 더 엄격하다고 볼 수 있으므로 이 설명은 타당하다.  

- **선택지 D**: ""파생 접미사는 품사를 바꿀 수도 있지만, 어미는 품사를 바꾸지 않는다.""  
  파생 접미사는 품사 변경이 가능(예: 명사 + 적 = 형용사), 어미는 문법적 변형만 할 뿐 품사를 변경하지 않는다. 이 설명은 정확하다.

The question asks which statement about the requirements for acquiring South Korean nationality is **incorrect**. 

- **Option A** correctly states that a child acquires Korean nationality at birth if either parent is a Korean national (jus sanguinis principle). This aligns with Article 2 of the Nationality Act.
- **Option B** is correct: Abandoned children (기아) found in Korea are legally presumed to be born there, per Article 3 of the Nationality Act.
- **Option C** is accurate: Naturalization (귀화) and recognition (인지, e.g., for foundlings or overseas Koreans) are valid post-birth methods of acquiring nationality.
- **Option D** is **incorrect**. Korean nationality is **not** automatically granted at birth based solely on being born in Korea if one parent is not a national. Birthright citizenship (jus soli) is **very limited** in South Korea. Specifically, a child born in Korea only acquires nationality at birth if **at least one parent is Korean** (covered in Option A). If **both** parents are foreigners, the child does **not** gain Korean nationality by birth, regardless of birthplace. Option D misleadingly suggests that having one non-national parent (while the other’s status is unspecified) combined with birth in Korea guarantees nationality, which is false.

Thus, D is the incorrect statement.

To determine which statement about constitutional history is incorrect, each option must be evaluated against historical facts.  

- **Option A**: The 1948 Constitution (the founding constitution) indeed included provisions for local autonomy (local government systems), specifically in Article 119. This makes A correct.  
- **Option B**: The 1960 April Revolution led to the 4th amendment, which first introduced the requirement for a national referendum to approve constitutional amendments. This is accurate, so B is correct.  
- **Option C**: Consumer protection rights were **not** first stipulated in the 1980 8th amendment. They were actually introduced in the **1987 9th amendment** (Article 35 of the current Constitution). Thus, C is factually incorrect.  
- **Option D**: The 1987 9th amendment did include the crime victim relief request right (Article 77-2 of the Constitution). This is correct.
